</div>

<hr class="r5">

<p>At a rough estimate there are 400 million
civilized human beings who have heard of Bill
Cody, not under his real name, but by the name
everybody called him, "Buffalo Bill."</p>

<p>His character made him an outstanding figure
during a period of the development of America
when a strong character was a matter of vital
necessity.</p>

<p>We doubt, however, whether the man's work
is fully appreciated, or ever has been. In the
rush and bustle that followed the introduction
of the railroad to the West, the results of Buffalo
Bill's work were more or less overlooked, but
a time is coming when this remarkable man's
achievements will be fully appreciated.</p>

<p>This is the character whose adventures are
dealt with in Buffalo Bill's Border Stories.</p>

<p>Read them. You will find them of true historical
value.</p>

<p class="center">INTRODUCES THE READER TO TOMMY.</p>


<p>"Mother!" exclaimed Mr. Smithers, as he came into
the parlor about supper time one winter evening, "that
boy's a fool."</p>

<p>Mrs. Smithers, who was a quiet-looking, blond little
woman, about thirty-five years of age, looked up from a
book she was reading, and regarded her husband with a
weary air.</p>

<p>"What boy?" she asked, languidly.</p>

<p>"As if you didn't know?" replied Mr. Smithers.</p>

<p>"We have two," she said, calmly.</p>

<p>"Oh, that boy, Tommy."</p>

<p>"What has he done now?"</p>

<p>"Done! why he is always doing something absurd. I
told him this morning, before I went out, to cut up all the
wood in the yard."</p>

<p>"I'm sure he'd do anything you'd tell him," said Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
Smithers, in a tone of conciliation; "he's only too anxious
to please. I am positive that he has been hard at work
all day, for I heard him chopping and sawing."</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Mr. Smithers, "he's chopped and
sawed a little too much. Not only did he cut up the wood,
but he's pulled down the fences on both sides of the yard,
torn up the supports of the grapevine, and even made
firewood of the sawbuck."</p>

<p>"He's too full of zeal; in fact, the poor boy wants to
do too much," Mrs. Smithers rejoined. "You oughtn't
to blame him for that; as he grows older he'll know
better."</p>

<p>"I doubt it, ma'am. I doubt it very much," replied her
husband, seating himself before the stove.</p>

<p>Mr. Smithers was a tall, consequential man, in the
prime of life, dark in complexion and not bad looking.</p>

<p>His wife was a widow when he married her, and she
had one son, the Tommy of whom Smithers was now
complaining.</p>

<p>Our friend was commonly called "Soft" Tommy, on account
of the simplicity of his nature and the numerous
mistakes he was constantly making.</p>

<p>His age was thirteen, and he was a pale, delicate-looking
boy, with a mild voice and a dreamy eye, fair
hair, thin lips and an undecided sort of mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>By her marriage with Mr. Smithers, Tommy's mother
had two children, a boy and a girl, who had respectively
received the high-sounding names of Harold Stamford
Smithers and Alice Regina Smithers.</p>

<p>Mr. Smithers himself was a clerk in a New York dry-goods
house, and he resided in a quiet part of Jersey City,
about half a mile from the ferry.</p>

<p>He prided himself upon being high-toned, and above
all things boasted that he was master in his own house.</p>

<p>Poor little Mrs. Smithers knew this to her cost, for
she received many a scolding, especially on Tommy's account,
without daring to "talk back."</p>

<p>Smithers was very fond of his own two children, Harold
Stamford and Alice Regina, both of whom he spoiled
dreadfully.</p>

<p>One was eleven, the other ten, and they were as disagreeable,
self-willed and conceited as overindulgence
could make them.</p>

<p>Perhaps Smithers had a stepfather's dislike for Tommy.</p>

<p>One thing is certain, he frequently beat him and rarely
said a word to the others.</p>

<p>Mrs. Smithers always looked sad and worried, which
was no wonder, as she had to put up with a great deal
from her husband.</p>

<p>She was a bad manager, was idle, and hated a disturbance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
of any kind, so that the children might do almost
anything without her interfering with them.</p>

<p>"I hope you didn't beat the boy," remarked Mrs. Smithers,
after a pause.</p>

<p>"He ran too fast for me," replied Smithers, "and took
refuge in neighbor Barker's house."</p>

<p>"He'll be all right there, and when he wants his supper
he'll come in," said Mrs. Smithers.</p>

<p>"It's a pity we can't choose our neighbors!" exclaimed
her husband. "There's that Barker—he's an undertaker;
it's a ghastly trade, and I've remarked that Tommy is
more friendly with Charley Barker, the coffin maker's
son, than he is with his own brother and sister."</p>

<p>"He must have some one to play with."</p>

<p>"Granted; but he needn't associate with those beneath
him."</p>

<p>"The Barkers are hard-working and very respectable,"
Mrs. Smithers ventured to observe.</p>

<p>"Oh, very!" answered Smithers, sarcastically; "very
much so indeed. I'm not saying anything against them.
Still, they are not on a par with us, and if your first husband
was a mechanic and left you with an only child, an
infant at that, to go and work and die in the Nevada
mines, I am not supposed to share your tastes."</p>

<p>"Poor man," said Mrs. Smithers, "there was no work<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
for him here. He thought he would do so much better
for all of us out West. He promised to send for me and
Tommy soon."</p>

<p>"Well, he died, and he couldn't help it," put in Smithers,
who was in a bad temper.</p>

<p>"We can't always do what we propose; and Thompson,
my dear, dear first husband, was as good as they make
them."</p>

<p>"He was a bold and exceedingly vulgar kind of person,"
rejoined Mr. Smithers, in a withering tone of voice.</p>

<p>"I'm sure Thompson was as genteel as—as Smithers,"
said his wife.</p>

<p>"Possibly he may have been in your estimation; but we
will not discuss the question. Be good enough to get my
supper ready," replied Smithers, with a grand wave of
the arm.</p>

<p>"I'll do that with pleasure, only do make some allowance
for Tommy—you know he is subject to the chills."</p>

<p>"You give me a chill, talking so much. Where are
Harold and Alice?"</p>

<p>"Gone visiting."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. I forgot that I gave them permission this
morning to visit the Macphersons. Highly respectable
family, the Macphersons. I will go and bring them home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
in a couple of hours' time. The ground is slippery with
the frozen snow, and they might fall and hurt themselves."</p>

<p>Mrs. Smithers sighed.</p>

<p>She wished her husband would be as kind to Tommy as
he was to Harold Stamford and Alice Regina.</p>

<p>Smithers had taken the trouble to go to Fulton Market
and buy six dozen oysters, which he wanted roasted, and
his wife went to get them ready for supper.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tommy, accompanied by Mr. Barker, the
undertaker, entered the room.</p>

<p>Tommy hung behind at the door, for he was afraid of
his father, but the undertaker, who was a fiery, shock-headed
little man, free and easy in his manner, and fond
of his glass and his pipe, walked right in.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, neighbor," he exclaimed. "I've
brought your boy back."</p>

<p>"Ah! Barker! Pray take a seat," replied Smithers,
who, though he disliked the undertaker, was secretly
afraid of him.</p>

<p>"I can stand."</p>

<p>"Sit down, I say; you're just in time for supper.
Oysters from Fulton Market. First-class, I tell you."</p>

<p>"No, no," said Barker. "I only came here with
Tommy because he was afraid to come alone. You won't
lick him, now?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<p>"I don't see what you have to do with it, really, Barker."</p>

<p>"He did not understand about cutting up the wood."</p>

<p>"That is the trouble of it; he never will understand,"
replied Smithers, with a complacent smile.</p>

<p>"He's a good boy enough, and he and my Charley get
along together first rate."</p>

<p>"Stay to supper, and we'll talk this thing over."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't mind if I do, though it's more for
Tommy's sake than for anything else," answered Barker.</p>

<p>"Tommy, our neighbor is right," said his father.
"You probably did not mean to do wrong, and I will
not whip you this time. Now, you can go down to your
mother and see if there is anything you can do in the
preparation of supper."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, certainly, sir," responded Tommy, his face
beaming with smiles, as he saw that Barker had got him
off the thrashing he expected.</p>

<p>His father kept a rattan in the corner of the room,
which he devoted to Tommy's sole use, it never being
employed upon the favored persons of Harold Stamford
and Alice Regina.</p>

<p>"Now, Smithers," said Barker, "you ought to let up
on that boy."</p>

<p>"Why should I, when he's the fool of the family?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<p>"He can't help it."</p>

<p>"Will you admit he's a fool?"</p>

<p>"I guess he's a little soft, that's all, and your severity
makes him no better."</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw!" said Smithers. "Spare the rod and
spoil the child."</p>

<p>"That's played out."</p>

<p>"Since when?"</p>

<p>"Long ago. Try kindness."</p>

<p>Mr. Smithers grew rather red in the face.</p>

<p>"I have every respect for you," he remarked, looking
sideways at the stove. "But I don't see why you should
interfere with my family affairs."</p>

<p>"Because I like the lad. Why don't you apprentice him
to some one?"</p>

<p>"To whom?"</p>

<p>"To me, if you like. I'll take him."</p>

<p>Mr. Smithers laughed in a tremulous manner.</p>

<p>"What!" he exclaimed. "Apprentice him to an undertaker?"</p>

<p>"Why not? You might require his services sooner
than you expect. If ours is not such a respectable trade
as the dry-goods business, we are as much in request as
you are. You clothe the living, we clothe the dead."</p>

<p>"I couldn't hear of such a thing," replied Smithers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
"Besides, the boy hasn't finished his schooling. He
knows nothing."</p>

<p>Tommy re-entered the room and spread a snow-white
cloth over the table.</p>

<p>"There's a little man," said Barker, encouragingly.
"What a nice tablecloth."</p>

<p>"'Tain't a tablecloth," replied Tommy. "It's a sheet.
Mother says the clothes ain't out of the wash yet."</p>

<p>Mr. Smithers looked disgusted.</p>

<p>"Didn't I tell you he was a fool?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"He's only simple," replied Barker.</p>

<p>"What does he know? He's going to school next week,
and I'll bet he can't tell you what he wants for books."</p>

<p>"I'll ask him," said Barker. "Come here, Tommy,
won't you?"</p>

<p>Tommy approached him without any hesitation, and
showed none of that fear which he exhibited when spoken
to by his stepfather.</p>

<p>"How much money do you want for school books,
Tom?" asked Barker.</p>

<p>"None at all," replied Tommy.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I don't like skule," said Tommy, with his hands behind
his back.</p>

<p>"But you've got to go, and what will it cost?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>"About four dollars, sir."</p>

<p>"How's that?" demanded Mr. Smithers, sharply. "I
bought Harold Stamford's books yesterday, and they
didn't come to that. Name the books."</p>

<p>"Lemme see," answered Tommy. "Singin' book, 'rithmetic,
jography."</p>

<p>"Well," said his stepfather, "the first is sixty cents, the
second seventy-five, the third a dollar and twenty. I
insist upon knowing how you make it out."</p>

<p>He took up the cane which stood in the corner and
held it up threateningly.</p>

<p>"Don't hit me and I'll tell you," replied Tommy.
"There's half a dollar for a new bat, a dollar for a pair
of skates and a quarter for candy."</p>

<p>Mr. Barker burst out laughing.</p>

<p>"I tell you he's smart," he exclaimed, "and you can't
punish him for telling the truth."</p>

<p>"I won't this time," replied Mr. Smithers. "Yet I don't
half like this sort of thing. Go an' give the horse his
supper, Tom."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Tommy.</p>

<p>He hurried off as if he was glad to get away.</p>

<p class="center">HOW SMITHERS FOUND CONSOLATION.</p>


<p>While Tommy was gone Mrs. Smithers came up and
laid the table, for although her husband was high-toned,
he did not choose to keep a servant.</p>

<p>In ten minutes Tommy came back.</p>

<p>"Did you feed the horse?" asked Mr. Smithers.</p>

<p>"I gave him the supper," replied Tommy; "but he
wouldn't touch it."</p>

<p>"That's strange," remarked Smithers.</p>

<p>"I think that plug of yours is ailing," said Barker, "and
it's a wonder to me why you keep him."</p>

<p>"Well, you see," replied Smithers, "I got him cheap,
and having a good barn at the back, I thought he'd be
handy to take to the ferry, and to go out with Sundays
and holidays."</p>

<p>"That's so."</p>

<p>"Tommy," said Smithers, "what did you give him?"</p>

<p>The boy was about to answer when Mrs. Smithers
rushed into the room.</p>

<p>"Where's the oysters?" she almost screamed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span></p>

<p>"How should I know?" replied her husband. "Didn't
I give them to you to cook?"</p>

<p>"You did, and I roasted them beautifully, took the top
shells off, and left them on the stove in a big dish, while
I went upstairs to tidy up."</p>

<p>Mr. Smithers bent a severe glance on Tommy.</p>

<p>"What did you give the horse?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The supper," replied Tommy.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"The oysters. Thought that was what you meant."</p>

<p>Mrs. Smithers clasped her hands together, and uttered
a cry.</p>

<p>"Do horses eat oysters?" demanded Smithers, furiously.</p>

<p>"How could I tell?" answered Tommy. "I've heard of
donkeys eating thistles."</p>

<p>"What would you like to eat, you donkey?"</p>

<p>"A mild tongue," said Tommy.</p>

<p>"How do you mean, you idiot?"</p>

<p>"Do be quiet, dear," cried Mrs. Smithers.</p>

<p>"Am I to be insulted by this idiot of yours, madam?"
thundered Smithers.</p>

<p>The wife raised her apron to her eyes and began to cry.</p>

<p>Smithers seized Tommy by the ear and pulled it, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"What do you mean? Are you luny?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>"I meant a beef tongue, not too much salted," replied
Tommy.</p>

<p>"What did you do with the oysters?"</p>

<p>"Won't you lick me, if I tell you?"</p>

<p>"N-no."</p>

<p>"When I found the horse wouldn't look at them, I
called Charley Barker, and we polished them off between
us."</p>

<p>Mr. Smithers let go of Tommy's ear and looked at him
ferociously.</p>

<p>"You young villain!" he exclaimed; "I'll skin you some
of these days."</p>

<p>At this Mrs. Smithers burst into a fresh torrent of grief.</p>

<p>"Oh, that I should have to hear my boy called such a
name!" she sobbed.</p>

<p>"Silence, woman!" roared her husband.</p>

<p>She sank into a chair, exhausted, and redoubled her
groans and tears.</p>

<p>"See here," exclaimed Barker, "I'll send for some more.
There's no harm done."</p>

<p>"No, you won't," replied Smithers. "You're just as
bad as the boy. I could see you snickering all the time,
and it's the last chance you'll have of coming into my
house."</p>

<p>"I can get out of it," said Barker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span></p>

<p>"Git!"</p>

<p>This was said in such a contemptuous manner that
Barker had no alternative.</p>

<p>Putting on his hat, he went.</p>

<p>When he was gone, Smithers attempted to do what he
had not dared to undertake while the undertaker was in
the room.</p>

<p>Seizing his rattan, he rushed upon Tommy.</p>

<p>His mother threw herself between them, and Tommy
escaped the intended blows, but his stepfather chased him
around the room, uttering frantic cries.</p>

<p>The door being open, the boy thought it would be only
prudent to make his escape.</p>

<p>"You rascal! you dunce!" cried Smithers. "The idea
of giving oysters to horses! I'll be even with you!"</p>

<p>Tommy banged the door after him, and his stepfather,
having put his hand on it, got badly crushed.</p>

<p>He withdrew his hand covered with blood, and as he
sucked his fingers he danced an original fandango on the
floor.</p>

<p>At this moment the door opened and a boy's form
appeared.</p>

<p>Blinded with rage and smarting with pain, Smithers
struck out with the cane.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>"Oh, pa!" cried the boy; "what have I done? It's me,
Harold. Look out, or you'll hit Ally."</p>

<p>Mr. Smithers groaned again.</p>

<p>In the passion of the moment he struck his own child,
Harold, who, with his sister, had just returned from the
party.</p>

<p>"My darling!" he exclaimed, "I'm truly sorry. It was
that stupid, that silly, that insane beast, Tommy, I meant
to chastise."</p>

<p>"What's he done, pa?"</p>

<p>"Don't ask me. Maria, I'm going down the street, to
the drug store, to have my hand dressed."</p>

<p>"You shouldn't be so violent," she said.</p>

<p>"Just keep that boy out of my sight when I come back,
that's all."</p>

<p>"I can't help his making mistakes."</p>

<p>"I'll kill or cure him, anyway."</p>

<p>"When shall you be back?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Don't be long. I'm tired and hungry. We've had
no supper," said Mrs. Smithers.</p>

<p>"I shall get mine outside."</p>

<p>"What am I to do? I've had none."</p>

<p>"You may thank your precious brat for that, madam.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
Give oysters to a horse! Oh, my, I'll never get over it!"
cried Mr. Smithers.</p>

<p>Wrapping his injured hand in a handkerchief, he
rushed from the house, leaving his wife alone with Harold
Stamford and Alice Regina.</p>

<p>"What is the matter with pa, ma, dear?" asked Alice.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't bother me," said Mrs. Smithers, swaying
herself to and fro in the rocking-chair.</p>

<p>"Wasn't he mad?" remarked Harold. "I never saw
him so before. It was all that Tommy's doing, I'll bet."</p>

<p>"Go up to bed, both of you," said Mrs. Smithers.</p>

<p>"I won't for one," exclaimed Alice. "Will you, Harold?"</p>

<p>"Not much," replied the boy.</p>

<p>"Your father will punish you when he comes back."</p>

<p>"No he won't—he likes us too much, and we don't care
for you, ma, when pa isn't here," said Alice.</p>

<p>Mrs. Smithers sighed again, but made no further effort
to get the children to bed.</p>

<p>She knew they were their father's spoiled pets, and
that it was useless, with her weak mind and undecided
character, to attempt to control them in his absence.</p>

<p>So, while she sat silently crying to herself, Harold
Stamford and Alice Regina got out the board and amused
themselves with a game of checkers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>

<p>It was past midnight when Smithers returned, with
rather an unsteady gait, and a glaziness about his eyes,
which, taken in connection with the huskiness of his voice,
led his wife to suppose that he had been drinking.</p>

<p>"This is a nice time to come home," she said, with
more than her usual boldness.</p>

<p>"Very nicesh timesh," he answered, hiccoughing.</p>

<p>"Where have you been?"</p>

<p>"Looking for boysh they call Shoft Tommy—hic—that'sh
where I've been."</p>

<p>"Did you find him?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, he's not come in," said Mrs. Smithers, "and it's
my opinion that your harshness has driven him to some
rash act."</p>

<p>"Run away, do you think?" exclaimed Smithers. "Oh,
dear, no—hic—Tommy's too good a judge of when he'sh
well off. Light my—hic—candlesh, and I'll go to bed."</p>

<p>Smithers was accommodated with a light, and in some
mysterious manner retired without breaking his neck or
setting the house on fire.</p>

<p>Harold and Alice followed their father's example, but
Mrs. Smithers remained up till the small hours, waiting
for Tommy to come back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>The fire in the stove went out, and the daylight peeped
through the shades. Still the anxious mother watched.</p>

<p>When Tommy managed to escape from his father's
anger, he ran to the back of Mr. Barker's house, where
he knew he was sure of protection and shelter.</p>

<p>In the kitchen he found Charles Barker, a boy about
his own age.</p>

<p>"Hello, Tommy," exclaimed Charley; "weren't those
oysters bully?"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid to go home, through them," answered
Tommy. "It seems as if I made another mistake. They
weren't for the horse's supper at all. I wish I was a little
smarter. Father will knock the life out of me when he
catches me."</p>

<p>"Let him sleep over it," said Charley, "that's what I
do when pop's mad with me. Sleep out all night, and let
him go to business before you show up."</p>

<p>"Where can I stay?"</p>

<p>"In our house. You can go up in the carpenter's shop
and sleep in one of the coffins. I'd give you half my bed,
but father's so funny-tempered he might lick us both, if
he found that I'd kept you out."</p>

<p>"That's so; and for want of a better roost, I'll do as
you say."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>"Come at once, for I hear pop upstairs, going on at
mamma as he always does when he's in a bad temper."</p>

<p>Charley went into the yard, followed by his friend
Tommy, on whom he thought he was conferring a great
favor in allowing him to sleep in a coffin.</p>

<p>The snow was lying about in heaps, and the idea that
it would be great fun to snowball somebody at once struck
Charley.</p>

<p>"Say!" he exclaimed, "let's go down street and snowball
Darky John."</p>

<p>"All right," replied Tommy.</p>

<p>"You fire at him, and I'll make a grab at his candy
and divvy with you afterward."</p>

<p>"Just's you say."</p>

<p>Darky John was a good-tempered colored man who
kept a candy store.</p>

<p>The boys were always playing him some trick or another,
and, indeed, they made his life a misery and a burden
to him.</p>

<p>As usual, Soft Tommy did not see the drift of his
friend's proposal.</p>

<p>He ran the risk of getting all the blows, and Charley
all the candy.</p>

<p>A few minutes' walk brought them to Darky John's.
He was standing behind his counter, and was suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
roused from the contemplation of a batch of red and blue-colored
sugar pigs by the forcible contact of a snowball
with his nose.</p>

<p>"Ki!" he said, "dat's too rough for dis chile to stand.
Who fire dat ball?"</p>

<p>"Give him a couple more, and make him come out after
you," whispered Charley.</p>

<p>Tommy threw two more balls, one of which raised a
commotion among the bottles on a shelf, the other broke
on John's ear, and its flaky particles streamed down his
neck.</p>

<p>"Fore de lord, dat's too much. What I gwine to do
now? If I cotch dat boy, I'll have to make him feel
mighty sick!" exclaimed Darky John.</p>

<p>Catching sight of Tommy he ran out of the shop and
chased him up the street.</p>

<p>Charley, meanwhile, entered the store and filled his
pockets with candy.</p>

<p class="center">FUN ENDS IN TRAGEDY.</p>


<p>Fat and lazy, Nigger John did not succeed in overtaking
Tommy, and at length gave up the chase, vowing
vengeance upon him when he got him in his power.</p>

<p>The boys met at the corner of the street and divided
the candy.</p>

<p>"Now, what's the next move?" said Charley. "Do you
want to creep into your deal box?"</p>

<p>"I don't care," replied Tommy, with a shiver.</p>

<p>"You needn't be afraid. The old man's got no stiff up
in the shop just now."</p>

<p>"It's horrid, though, to go among coffins, and your
father does keep the dead bodies there sometimes."</p>

<p>"Of course he does. I've seen half a dozen at a time
waiting to be boxed up, but they can't hurt you. They're
harmless enough; it's nothing when you're used to it."</p>

<p>"Anyway," said Tommy, "it's better than going home
to be licked."</p>

<p>"I'll bet yer," replied Charley.</p>

<p>While sucking their candy and talking they were approached
by another boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>"Hello, Charley!" exclaimed the newcomer; "was that
you snowballing Nigger John?"</p>

<p>"I never give myself away, Swanny Marsh," replied
Charley.</p>

<p>"He's awful mad. I wanted to sell him two pigeons for
candy and he wouldn't deal."</p>

<p>"I'll trade with you."</p>

<p>"What'll you give?"</p>

<p>"My jackknife, a handful of candies and a dozen marbles."</p>

<p>"Can't do it," replied Swanny Marsh; "they're worth
more."</p>

<p>"You can keep them," said Charley.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I'd like to do with them," continued
the owner of the pigeons.</p>

<p>"What's that?"</p>

<p>"There's a lecture on to-night in Julian Hall. I went
there and got a seat up in the gallery. Just under me
there was a man with a bald head, and I dropped a marble
down right on top of him. Jimanetti! you should
have heard him howl and seen him jump!"</p>

<p>"Did they tumble you?"</p>

<p>"Like my bad luck, they did. A mean cuss saw me do
it, and I was bounced. Now, I'll let you have the pigeons,
if you'll throw them up through the door of the hall."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span></p>

<p>"What's the fun of that?"</p>

<p>"They'll fly all around and put the gas out, and we'll
holler 'Fire!' like fury. It'll be all a lark to see the folks
run for the door," replied Marsh.</p>

<p>"Good boy, Swanny!" said Charley.</p>

<p>"Will you do it?"</p>

<p>"Tommy will, won't you, Tommy?" exclaimed Charley.</p>

<p>"I don't mind," answered Tommy, in his usual good-natured
way.</p>

<p>"That settles it," said Swanny Marsh. "Here are the
birds."</p>

<p>He produced a paper bag, in which were two full-grown
pigeons.</p>

<p>"Come on to Julian Hall. Open the door a little way
and let the birds fly," exclaimed Charley Barker. "It'll
be such fun."</p>

<p>Tommy thought so, too, but he did not stop to consider
the matter thoroughly in all its bearings.</p>

<p>This is the trouble with most boys. They do not stop
to think, and, acting as creatures of impulse, they often
do mischievous things, which produce disastrous results,
without meaning any real harm.</p>

<p>Reaching the hall, which contained about three hundred
people, who were listening to an instructive lecture,
Tommy opened the door a little way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span></p>

<p>He attracted no notice.</p>

<p>Then he opened the paper bag, and the birds flew out
among the audience.</p>

<p>Rushing hither and thither, the pigeons, by the motion
of their wings, soon extinguished the lights. The hall
was wrapped in darkness.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Charley Barker and Swanny Marsh cried
"Fire! fire!" with all their might, and Tommy joined in
the din.</p>

<p>Not knowing how or why the lights had been put out,
the audience became panic-stricken.</p>

<p>They made a rush for the doorway, which speedily became
blocked.</p>

<p>Now a terrible scene ensued, which the boys were far
from intending, or even anticipating.</p>

<p>The doorway became jammed with a fighting, struggling
mass of humanity, yelling, shrieking and pushing to
escape.</p>

<p>Delicate women and children were trampled under foot,
and the darkness made the scene more dreadful.</p>

<p>There was only one door to the hall, which was all the
worse for the people.</p>

<p>The three boys left off crying "Fire! fire!" when they
saw the people coming out.</p>

<p>They grew frightened at the terrible uproar, and with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
blanched faces stood on the outskirts of a quickly increasing
crowd.</p>

<p>The police came up and rendered effectual assistance.</p>

<p>In a quarter of an hour the hall was cleared, and beyond
bruises and cuts, none of the grown people were seriously
injured.</p>

<p>Some women were carried out fainting and bleeding;
but one sight caused a thrill of horror to run through the
assembling crowd.</p>

<p>The police had picked up a little boy—dead!</p>

<p>He was a tiny little fellow, about seven years old, and
as they placed the lifeless body on a shutter, many a
strong man felt inclined to shed tears.</p>

<p>This was the only one killed.</p>

<p>"He's a goner," whispered Charley to his companions.
"Who'd have thought that?"</p>

<p>"It's rough," replied Swanny Marsh. "Wonder who's
young one he is."</p>

<p>"Don't know."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Tommy, "I'm so sorry we did it."</p>

<p>"So'm I, now," answered Marsh.</p>

<p>The shutter, with the youthful corpse upon it, was taken
up by four stout men.</p>

<p>"Where are they going to take it?" asked Charley of
a man in the crowd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span></p>

<p>"Up to Barker's, the undertaker's," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Whose boy is it?"</p>

<p>"They say it's Marsh's; him as lives up the avenue.
Little Tony Marsh, I heard them call him, and they won't
take him home, 'cos the mother's sick, and the shock might
kill her."</p>

<p>These were cruel words for Swanny to hear, but he did
hear them, and they sank into his heart like lead.</p>

<p>"Oh, God!" he murmured, "I have killed my little
brother."</p>

<p>Then his lips became whiter than his cheeks, and he
would have fallen to the ground had not Charley Barker
caught him.</p>

<p>"Say, Tommy," exclaimed Charley, "this is awful!"</p>

<p>"What'll I do?" asked Tommy.</p>

<p>"Say nothing to anybody. Watch your chance to get
into the shop, and hide away in a coffin, as I told you."</p>

<p>"But how about poor Swanny Marsh?"</p>

<p>"I'll take him home. Don't bother yourself about him."</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>"Don't forget; you're not to squeal. I must post
Swanny when he comes to. If you don't look out we shall
all get sent up."</p>

<p>Tommy nodded his head, as if he quite comprehended
the warning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>He walked sadly away, and Charley, in time, with
some difficulty, got Swanny home.</p>

<p>The state of affairs at home can be easily imagined—a
hysterical mother, a father frenzied with grief, one little
bed empty, its occupant gone forever, and the house of
mourning, desolation and despair.</p>

<p>But crushed with grief as he was, and overwhelmingly
shocked, Swanny Marsh did not say anything.</p>

<p>He kept the horrid secret locked up in his breast.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">A NIGHT IN A COFFIN.</p>


<p>Tommy watched the undertaker's house from a distance,
saw the body of the dead child taken in, waited till
the crowd dispersed, and then crept into the house by the
back way.</p>

<p>The room in which the coffins were stored was up one
flight of stairs.</p>

<p>No one saw him go up.</p>

<p>He pushed the door open, and the pale moonlight
streamed in on piles of coffins, some made of common
pine and others of handsomely polished wood.</p>

<p>These latter were the elegant caskets of the rich.</p>

<p>Pieces of wood and carpenters' tools lay all about, but
what arrested Tommy's attention was a white cloth.</p>

<p>This was stretched over a plainly-made coffin.</p>

<p>Actuated by an irresistible impulse, he approached and
lifted the cloth.</p>

<p>A convulsive shudder ran through his limbs.</p>

<p>He had disclosed the pallid features of the dead boy,
the poor unfortunate who had come to his untimely end
through the thoughtless joke of his friends and himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p>It was dreadful to have to sleep in the same room with
the dead.</p>

<p>"I'll put it out of sight," said he to himself.</p>

<p>Lifting up the coffin containing the dead child, he hid
it under the carpenter's bench.</p>

<p>It was a cold night, and he kept the sheet.</p>

<p>There was a boy's coffin on the floor, and he crept in.</p>

<p>It just fitted him.</p>

<p>Drawing the white cloth or sheet over himself, he soon
fell asleep, in spite of the dismal and ghastly surroundings.</p>

<p>An hour later Barker, the undertaker, entered.</p>

<p>"I guess I'll just nail a lid over that 'stiff,'" he muttered.
"I've known cats to come in here and gnaw the
hands and faces. There'll be an inquest to-morrow, and
it'll be best to have it look decent."</p>

<p>Taking up a board, he placed it over the coffin in which
Soft Tommy was sleeping.</p>

<p>Then he drove in half a dozen long nails.</p>

<p>The sound of the nailing roused Tommy, who tried to
cry out, but the lid was so close to his face that he could
not.</p>

<p>He felt a sense of suffocation.</p>

<p>In vain he endeavored to raise an alarm.</p>

<p>A nameless horror took possession of him. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
worse than a nightmare, or anything that can be produced
by physical suffering.</p>

<p>It was the fear that he was going to be buried alive—that,
in fact, he was already nailed up in his casket and
on his way to the silent tomb.</p>

<p>"That fixes it," he heard Mr. Barker say. "Now I'll
go to bed."</p>

<p>"Mr. Bar-Barker," Tommy strove to say, but his tongue
clove to the roof of his mouth.</p>

<p>The words died on his lips.</p>

<p>A dizziness came over him, his head seemed to swim,
and he lost consciousness.</p>

<p>The undertaker had nailed him in the coffin, and he was
alone with the dead.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Charley Barker went to sleep, after leaving Tommy,
but he woke up with a bad dream, in which he had fancied
that his friend had fallen into a furnace and was
rapidly being reduced to a cinder.</p>

<p>He had witnessed the horrid scene distinctly in his
dream, the boy's arms were outstretched as if begging
help and protection, while his plaintive voice rang in his
ears.</p>

<p>A cold sweat broke out all over Charley, as he started<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
up in bed, and such was the impression that the dream
made on him, that he determined to go to the carpenters'
room and satisfy himself with his own eyes that all was
right.</p>

<p>It was fortunate indeed for Tommy that Charley had
his dream, for had he been left till morning in his confused
and cramped position, he would undoubtedly have
been a corpse.</p>

<p>Hastily slipping on his clothes, Charley crept out of
the room and stood a moment at the head of the stairs
to assure himself that all was quiet.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Barker had retired to rest, and the house
was consequently as still as the grave; so he boldly made
his way to the place where he had left Tommy.</p>

<p>Striking a match, he lighted a lantern, which cast a
lurid light over the pile of coffins, and, to his astonishment,
perceived that the wooden casket into which his
friend had crawled was nailed down.</p>

<p>"Dad's been up here," he muttered, "and I shouldn't
wonder if he hain't taken the living for the dead."</p>

<p>Seizing a screw-driver, he began to force off the lid,
finding his judgment correct, for there was Tommy
Smithers, breathing heavily, with the blood oozing from
his eyes, nose, mouth and ears.</p>

<p>"By thunder," he cried, "that was a lucky dream of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
mine. I'm only just in time; but better late than never;
a good motto, and he yet lives."</p>

<p>With some difficulty he lifted Tommy out of the coffin,
and placed him on the floor, when the cold air soon revived
him.</p>

<p>Opening his eyes, he looked curiously around him at
the strange surroundings, like one emerging from a
trance, but when his eyes fell upon Charley, his memory
seemed to come back to him, and he smiled faintly.</p>

<p>Presently he sat up and said:</p>

<p>"I guess your father nailed me down, thinking I was
Tony Marsh. But how did you come to know it?"</p>

<p>"It was through a dream I had," replied Charley.</p>

<p>"A dream," repeated Tommy, in surprise.</p>

<p>"Yes. I thought you were in a fiery furnace, and called
to me for help. The dream was so clear that I couldn't
sleep until I had come to see if you were all right."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Tommy, grasping his hand. "You
have saved my life."</p>

<p>He was trembling with excitement and shivering with
the cold, so that Charley concluded to offer him half his
bed.</p>

<p>"Come and turn in with me," he exclaimed. "I'll stand
a thrashing from father. You can't rest here."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>"No, indeed," answered Tommy, with a shudder. "I
came too near dying here to like the idea. Wouldn't it
have been horrible if I had gone to the grave that way?"</p>

<p>"I'll bet you. Wait while I put poor little Tony in the
box and fix the lid, or father will think something."</p>

<p>He took hold of Tony, and was about to place him
in the coffin when he dropped the body.</p>

<p>"What's the mat-matter?" asked Tommy, whose teeth
were chattering.</p>

<p>"He's warm yet," answered Charley.</p>

<p>"What you say?" cried Tommy. "It can't be, because
the doctor said he was a gone coon."</p>

<p>"I don't give a straw for what the doctor said," answered
Charley, going on his knees and putting his ear
to the boy's chest. "He's breathing," he continued, after
a slight pause, "and of course he can't be dead. This is
a night of miracles. Oh! ain't I just glad, that's all.
Swanny was awfully cut up, and so were we, to think that
our joke should have killed Tony."</p>

<p>"What'll we do?" inquired Tommy.</p>

<p>"Tell you what'll we do. You help me to carry him,
and we'll put him between us in my bed, and warm him."</p>

<p>Tommy was now strong enough to render the required<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
assistance, and the boys succeeded in getting the supposed
corpse into bed.</p>

<p>There were no bones broken in Tony's body, though
he was considerably crushed and bruised.</p>

<p>It was an undoubted fact that he lived, for in a couple
of hours he was so much recovered that he was able to
speak.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Swanny?" he asked.</p>

<p>The little fellow was accustomed to room with his
elder brother, and supposed they were in bed together.</p>

<p>Tommy had dropped off into a deep slumber, but
Charley Barker was awake.</p>

<p>"No, Tony; it's me, Charley Barker. You know me,
don't you?" he replied.</p>

<p>"Why, certainly. But why ain't I in my own house?
What has happened? I'm so sore all over."</p>

<p>"You got hurt when the people at the lecture had a
scare, and Swanny and I thought you'd be best here."</p>

<p>"Does mother know?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! Try and get to sleep, there's a good little
fellow. Swanny will be here good and early in the morning."</p>

<p>"I shall be glad to sleep, my head aches so, and I feel
quite dizzy, while my body is just as if I'd been beaten all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
over. Good-night, Charley; it was very kind of you to
take so much care of me."</p>

<p>Then the little fellow dozed off, and Charley Barker
sank to sleep with the sweet consciousness of having saved
two lives that night by his lucky dream.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">THE MAN WITH ONE EYE.</p>


<p>Charley Barker was up at daylight next day, and after
washing the blood from Tony's face, which was much
cut and disfigured, he hurried off to Swanny to acquaint
him with the good news.</p>

<p>Neither Mr. nor Mrs. Marsh had gone to bed at all,
for they were mourning the loss of their darling, and, on
being admitted to the house, Charley at once acquainted
them with what had occurred.</p>

<p>They could scarcely believe in the reality of such joyful
tidings, but started immediately for the undertaker's.</p>

<p>Mr. Barker, as we have said, was a rough-and-ready,
fiery sort of man, who at times did not attempt to restrain
his temper.</p>

<p>The father and mother had gone alone to his house, as
Charley had stayed behind to talk with Swanny.</p>

<p>It was about seven o'clock, and Barker was not up.</p>

<p>When he heard a furious ringing at his bell he jumped
out of bed in a passion, saying to his wife, who was also
aroused by the noise:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span></p>

<p>"I'll teach those fools, whoever they are, not to ring
my bell as if the house was on fire, dern me if I don't!"</p>

<p>Advancing to the window, he threw it open, and his
temper was not improved by the rush of cold air, which
struck a chill to his bones after leaving his nice, warm bed
a moment before.</p>

<p>"Be-low!" he shouted. "What in thunder do you
want?"</p>

<p>The tassel of his nightcap fluttered in the cold blast,
and particles of the crisp, frozen snow flew up in his face.</p>

<p>"Give me my child," replied Mr. Marsh.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you, Marsh," said the undertaker, in a milder
tone. "What's the use of asking for the body so early?
You'll have it in a neat casket about the middle of the
day. I can't work at night, besides, I didn't know you
were in such an all-fired hurry."</p>

<p>"It isn't the body we want, it's the child."</p>

<p>"Comes to the same thing, and you've got to wait."</p>

<p>"Open the door and let us in."</p>

<p>"No, I'm derned if I do. Come at a proper time,"
growled the undertaker.</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake, take pity on us!" cried Mrs.
Marsh. "Will not a mother's tears move you?"</p>

<p>"Not by a bucketful, marm."</p>

<p>"If you don't give up Tony, I'll get a warrant and have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
you arrested," roared Mr. Marsh. "Aren't you an inhuman
scoundrel? Want to kill him, I guess, for fear
you'll lose the job."</p>

<p>"Kill him! What do you mean? Oh, pshaw, you're
both crazy!" replied Barker, in a tone of deep disgust.
"Go home, and don't come fooling around here no more."</p>

<p>"Look here, Barker," exclaimed Mr. Marsh, "I'll——"</p>

<p>His further utterance was cut short by the sudden and
violent slamming of the window by the irate undertaker,
who, after consigning the interrupters of his repose to perdition,
crept once more into bed, and pulling the clothes
round his cold shoulders, prepared to sleep again.</p>

<p>At this moment Charley and Swanny came running up.</p>

<p>"Won't dad let you in?" asked Charley.</p>

<p>"No," replied Mr. Marsh. "This is an outrage. I shall
go for an officer."</p>

<p>"Don't do nothing of the sort. Come in with me at the
back door. Pop ain't to blame; he don't know anything
about the stiff coming to life," answered Charley.</p>

<p>The rage of Mr. and Mrs. Marsh moderated at once,
and they followed their conductor into the house through
the rear. Presently they were overjoyed at seeing their
darling.</p>

<p>Barker was roused, everything was explained, and Tony
was carried home by his anxious parents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span></p>

<p>Tommy also sought his domicile, finding his father and
mother in the kitchen.</p>

<p>"If that boy takes to stopping out nights," he heard
Mr. Smithers say, "he can stay away altogether, for what
I care."</p>

<p>"You forget," replied his mother, "that it was your
injustice and ungovernable temper that drove him out."</p>

<p>"He's such a fool, madam."</p>

<p>"Can he help being a little soft? Besides, he's quite
young yet."</p>

<p>At this juncture Tommy came forward.</p>

<p>"Here I am, mother," he said.</p>

<p>"Where have you been, sir?" demanded Mr. Smithers.</p>

<p>Tommy related the incidents of the night, which were
pronounced to be very wonderful.</p>

<p>"Well, I'll overlook it this time," said his stepfather;
"but don't let it happen again, or I'll take you into the
woodshed and welt you considerable."</p>

<p>Mrs. Smithers caught him in her arms, crying:</p>

<p>"Oh, my darling! I should never have got over it if
you had been buried in that coffin."</p>

<p>"Here, stop that blubbering!" exclaimed Smithers.
"Give me another cup of coffee; I must be off, or I'll be
late at the store!" And soon after he hastened off to the
ferry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<p>There was a ring at the bell. Mrs. Smithers dried her
tears, and added:</p>

<p>"See who that is."</p>

<p>Tommy opened the door, and a man, poorly dressed,
with a worn expression on his face, which was weather-beaten
and battered, stood on the stoop.</p>

<p>What made him more remarkable was the fact that he
had only one eye. No attempt was made to conceal the
defect, which might have been remedied by one of glass,
and the vacant space made him look even more homely
and ghastly.</p>

<p>"Does Mrs. Smithers reside here?" he inquired, in a
voice harsh and hoarse through drink and exposure to the
weather.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Tommy.</p>

<p>At this moment Mrs. Smithers raised her head, took one
long look at the stranger, and uttering a piercing shriek,
would have fallen to the ground had not Tommy rushed
forward and supported her with his arm.</p>

<p>The man with one eye smiled grimly, and showing no
outward concern, stepped into the house, closing the door
after him.</p>

<p>"Let go," he said. "Where's the parlor?"</p>

<p>"That door to the left," answered Tommy.</p>

<p>"Open it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Smithers had fainted, but the stranger took her
in his arms as if she had been a child.</p>

<p>"What's your game?" asked Tommy. "That's my
mother."</p>

<p>"I know it," was the calm reply.</p>

<p>"Don't touch her, you dirty-looking tramp!" continued
Tommy. "How dare you?"</p>

<p>"Because I am your father, and she is my wife."</p>

<p>At this remarkable and unexpected reply, Tommy
opened his eyes wide in amazement.</p>

<p>"Thought my father was dead?" he said.</p>

<p>"No matter what any of you thought, I am alive and
I am here. Open the door."</p>

<p>There was an air of authority about this man who
claimed to be the Mr. Thompson whom Mrs. Smithers
had first married, and Tommy no longer refused to obey
him.</p>

<p>He opened the door of the room in which a good fire
was burning, and the stranger carried the woman in, laying
her on a sofa, and chafing her hands so as to circulate
the blood and restore her to consciousness.</p>

<p>Tommy could scarcely realize the fact that this rough,
ragged and ugly man was the father of whom he had
heard his mother speak so often.</p>

<p>Young as he was when his father went West—only to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
die, as was reported and supposed—he remembered a very
different sort of person.</p>

<p>In the course of a few minutes, during which Tommy
remained standing near the closed door, in an awestruck
sort of manner, Mrs. Smithers became herself again.</p>

<p>Her mind was clear, and the passing faintness having
gone away, she looked the stranger in the face.</p>

<p>"Thomas," she said, softly, "what is the meaning of
this? I heard from one of your friends that you were
dead."</p>

<p>"All thought me so," he answered. "I was in a wild
part of the country, where I had gone to make money
for you and our child——"</p>

<p>A sickly smile overspread her delicate countenance.</p>

<p>"You left me to starve, and the child, too," she interrupted.</p>

<p>"Let that be as it may," he rejoined, "I went away.
You can put what construction you like on my actions."</p>

<p>"Well, go on," she said, in a tone of resignation.</p>

<p>"I'll admit," he continued, "that I was a drunkard and
a gambler; but I wasn't that when I left you. I intended
to do you good. A barroom quarrel nearly resulted in my
death. I was badly shot, badly kicked and lost one of my
eyes."</p>

<p>Mrs. Smithers covered her face with her hands, as if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
she could conjure up the horrible scene and wished to
shut it out.</p>

<p>"How have you been living since?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Heaven only knows. A friendly Indian took care of
me till I got well, and then I waited till I could get square
with my enemy."</p>

<p>"And he?"</p>

<p>"I slew him as I would a dog," said the man, Thompson.
"He begged for his life like a whining girl, but I
had him in a tight place, and he died by my hand."</p>

<p>"Horrible!" she muttered.</p>

<p>"Not at all. Didn't he disfigure me? I tell you that
out West we consider ourselves entitled to satisfaction in
cases of this kind."</p>

<p>"Why did you come here, Thomas?"</p>

<p>"To see you. I found out that you had married again,
and knowing that you were my property, I thought I
could make something out of you."</p>

<p>"Your property?" she repeated.</p>

<p>"Why, certainly. Does not a wife belong to her husband?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Smithers groaned.</p>

<p>"Do you wish to destroy me?" She asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no! I'll own up that you made a mistake
in marrying me—that I was always a bad husband, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
that you were better without than with me. Further than
that, I will confess that I don't blame you for taking the
first chance that offered after you heard of my death, because
you had to keep yourself and the child."</p>

<p>"Then why persecute me, Thomas?" inquired Mrs.
Smithers, raising her moist eyes to his.</p>

<p>"Simply because I think that I can get something out
of you. I am poor; 'dead broke' won't express my condition."</p>

<p>"And if you can levy blackmail upon me, you will be
satisfied?"</p>

<p>"For a time, yes."</p>

<p class="center">THE CONFIDENCE GAME.</p>


<p>"You never were a good man," said Mrs. Smithers,
looking down at the floor and moving her foot restlessly,
"but I didn't think you would have become so bad as you
have. However, I shall have to make a compromise with
you. Name your terms."</p>

<p>"Now you're talking," answered Thompson, with a
smile of satisfaction. "In the first place, I want all the
money and jewelry you can lay your hands on. You can
say the house was robbed."</p>

<p>"Yes, you shall have all," Mrs. Smithers replied.</p>

<p>"Secondly, I must have Tommy."</p>

<p>"For what?"</p>

<p>"No business of yours. If you don't let Tommy come
with me, I will see Mr. Smithers, and upset the whole
caboodle. Don't you forget it."</p>

<p>"You want to make him as bad as yourself, I know you
do," she said, impetuously, "and I will not let him go."</p>

<p>"All right. I'll stay here till Smithers comes back from
the dry-goods store where he is employed, and the chances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
are that he will kick the pair of you out when he hears
what I have to say."</p>

<p>"Is this manly or just, Thomas?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Neither one nor the other; but I have to do something
in New York this time, or I shall be sent up to the island
for the winter," replied Thompson, looking piercingly at
her with his one eye. "Take your choice."</p>

<p>"Come here, Tommy," said his mother.</p>

<p>"What is it, mamma?" he asked, taking her hand
tenderly.</p>

<p>"Will you go with your father?"</p>

<p>"Yes, to save you, mamma," answered Tommy.</p>

<p>"Then go, and God be with you," she said, and rising,
went to a handsome bureau, which she opened with a key.</p>

<p>Taking a roll of bills and some jewelry from a secret
drawer, she handed them to the stranger, adding:</p>

<p>"They are all I have."</p>

<p>The man's eyes gloated over the plunder which he
counted, exclaiming:</p>

<p>"Twenty dollars, three rings, a bracelet and a pair of
diamond rings. Little enough, but I will make it do."</p>

<p>Covering her face with her hands, the weak-minded
and unfortunate woman shed an abundance of tears.</p>

<p>"Come on," said Thompson to Tommy; "you're mine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
now. D'ye hear—or do you want a gentle reminder from
the toe of my boot?"</p>

<p>"You needn't kick me," replied Tommy.
"What I say I never go back on."</p>

<p>Bestowing an affectionate look on his mother, he followed
the stranger from the house, and in silence they
made their way to the ferry, by means of which they
crossed over to New York.</p>

<p>Thompson took him to a house in Dey Street, where
he boarded, and when they were alone in a room, he
lighted his pipe, and began to talk.</p>

<p>"How do you suppose I get my living, sonny?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Best way you know how, I guess," answered Tommy.</p>

<p>"Precisely. Sometimes I am a gambler, at others a
thief, now and then a monte man; but here, where I am
not known by the police, I mean to work the confidence
game."</p>

<p>"How's that done?" asked Tommy.</p>

<p>"It's as simple as playing policy. We'll go out presently
and look for a victim. I can always tell a countryman.
When I point him out to you, it will be your job
to go up to him and say:</p>

<p>"How are you, Mr. Jennings?"</p>

<p>"But suppose his name isn't Jennings?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span></p>

<p>"Of course it isn't," replied Thompson, "and he'll say:
'My name is not that, you've made a mistake.' Then you
say: 'Didn't my father work for yours in Buffalo,' and
he'll most likely answer by telling his real name and address,
after which you beg his pardon, and fall back to
tell me who he is."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"I shall go up to him, you keeping in the background,
accost him by his real name, and worm myself into his
confidence, the end of which will be that I shall get all
his money and valuables out of him in some saloon."</p>

<p>"That's cheating," said Tommy, bluntly.</p>

<p>"I know it's a State's prison offense; but a man must
live, and I'm too far gone to work now," replied Thompson.
Putting down his pipe, and replacing his hat on his
head, he told Tommy to accompany him to Broadway to
make his first attempt at the game of confidence.</p>

<p>Thompson was not yet acquainted with Tommy's aptitude
for making blunders, or he would not have been so
pleased at getting him as a decoy for unwary strangers.</p>

<p>They walked on till they came near Grand Street, where
Thompson saw an individual upon whom he thought he
could practice.</p>

<p>He was tall and gaunt, with a restless, inquisitive air,
looking into shop windows, and staring about him as if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
everything was new and he wanted to take in all he could
during a limited stay in the city.</p>

<p>"Here's the bloke!" exclaimed Thompson. "Go and do
what I told you, and leave me to play him for a sucker."</p>

<p>"All right," answered Tommy.</p>

<p>The boy approached the stranger, and pulling his
sleeve, accosted him, saying:</p>

<p>"How are you, Mr. Jennings?"</p>

<p>The man stopped abruptly, and with a sharp, clear eye
scanned his face.</p>

<p>Instead of answering as Tommy expected, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"How long have you been at this game, bub?"</p>

<p>"Not long, sir," replied Tommy, in his simple way. "I
only started on it just now."</p>

<p>"As I thought. Who put you up to it?"</p>

<p>"That man behind, sir, who is leaning against the lamp-post."</p>

<p>"If I told you my name you were to fall back and tell
him, and then he'd come up to me?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," he said, "you were a greenhorn, and he'd
play you for a sucker."</p>

<p>The tall man smiled.</p>

<p>"He never made a greater mistake in his life," was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
reply. "I'm pretty well posted on all these tricks, and I've
paid for my experience."</p>

<p>"What will I say to him?" asked Tommy.</p>

<p>The tall man advanced to where Thompson was waiting,
but when the latter saw him coming he concluded that
something was wrong, and ran.</p>

<p>A chase ensued. Thompson ran into the arms of an
officer, who held him till the tall man came up.</p>

<p>"What's the charge?" asked the officer.</p>

<p>"He tried to play confidence on me. I'm a detective
connected with Central office. Take him to headquarters,
while I find the boy. You know me, officer. I'm Maccabe."</p>

<p>"I guess I ought to," answered the policeman.</p>

<p>"Curse the boy! Did he give me away?" asked Thompson.</p>

<p>"In the worst way, but without meaning it," was the
answer.</p>

<p>"If I'd known he was such a fool, I'd never have traveled
with him," growled Thompson, bestowing some
choice oaths on Tommy, "and when I come out, after doing
the time I suppose you'll give me, I'll have satisfaction
out of his hide."</p>

<p>"Stop your chinning. You're my prisoner," said the
officer, hauling him off to Mulberry Street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span></p>

<p>Maccabe, the detective, who had assumed an innocent
air and a rough sort of dress on purpose to throw thieves
off their guard, looked around for Tommy. He was nowhere
to be seen.</p>

<p>Tommy had done the most sensible thing he ever did
in his life, which was to run away to the ferry and go
home again, consequently the detective couldn't catch him.
But the absence of Tommy did not save Thompson, who
was sent to the island as a rogue and a vagabond for
three months.</p>

<p>In the solitude of his cell he had ample opportunity to
plan his revenge upon the boy, and we must leave him to
brood over his future plans while we return to Jersey City.
It was afternoon when Tommy reached the house.</p>

<p>His father had left the store early, and was with Mrs.
Smithers in the parlor, the latter being hysterical.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you?" he heard his father say.
"I ask for the money in the bureau and all you do is to
cry."</p>

<p>Tommy entered the room, and his mother no sooner saw
him than she caught him in her arms, and kissed and
hugged him as if she had never expected to see him again.</p>

<p>"Oh! my dear, dear boy," she exclaimed, "Heaven be
thanked you are restored to me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>"I ran away from the man, mother, when the police
took him," said Tommy.</p>

<p>"Hush!" she cried, placing her fingers on her lip, warningly.</p>

<p>Mr. Smithers was interested. He saw that something
of an unusual nature had occurred during his absence,
and he was determined to find out what it was.</p>

<p>"What man?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"My father," replied Tommy, innocently. "He wasn't
dead, and turned up to-day."</p>

<p>"O-oh!" said Smithers, with a prolonged whistle;
"that's how the cat jumps, hey? Now I can see where
the money went. Soh! the late lamented Thompson has
come back, and you're not my wife by law."</p>

<p>Mrs. Smithers bestowed a wrathful look on Tommy.</p>

<p>She would not for the world that Smithers should have
got even the least glimmering of what had taken place
that day.</p>

<p>But it was too late for regrets. He knew all now.</p>

<p>She lay perfectly passive on the lounge, while Mr.
Smithers closely questioned Tommy, drawing from him
all the facts connected with Thompson's unexpected return
from the West, and the circumstances of his visit.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">TOMMY MAKES A STRANGE VOYAGE.</p>


<p>After pacing the room in a state of agitation for some
minutes, Mr. Smithers enjoined Tommy not to say a word
of what had happened to anybody, and ordered him to go
out and play, which the boy was very willing to do.</p>

<p>At length he took his wife's hand in his.</p>

<p>"My dear," he said, "on consideration, I do not blame
you in this affair. When you married me you believed
your first husband dead?"</p>

<p>"I did, indeed," she said, sobbing.</p>

<p>"You were weak and foolish to give him money, and
still more silly to let him have control of Tommy, whose
simpleness came in well for once, however."</p>

<p>"It broke my heart to part with him; but what could
I do?"</p>

<p>"In future leave this fellow to me, or we shall have
trouble. Will you do so?"</p>

<p>"I shall be only too glad."</p>

<p>"That settles all. You are forgiven, and if Thompson
dares to enter my door again I shall give him to the
police."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span></p>

<p>"But if he claims me and Tommy?"</p>

<p>"You can refuse to accompany him. The law will protect
you," replied Smithers.</p>

<p>"Oh! my dear, dear husband," exclaimed Mrs. Smithers,
smiling gratefully through her tears, "you are the
best of men."</p>

<p>"And with all your faults you are good enough for me,"
replied Smithers.</p>

<p>Then peace was restored between them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Tommy sought his friend, Charley Barker,
who was standing near an express wagon in the yard.</p>

<p>"Here's fun," exclaimed Charley. "Father's got a body
which is to go to England, and I'm to go with the expressman
and see it on board the steamer. Have you ever been
on board a liner?"</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like to go?"</p>

<p>"I'll bet yer!" replied Tommy.</p>

<p>"That settles it. We've got to hurry up, as the steamer
sails this afternoon. It's the <i>Umbria</i>, of the Cunard line,
and their docks are in Jersey City," said Charley.</p>

<p>Tommy, boylike, was delighted at the chance of a little
amusement of a novel nature, and waited with impatience
for the appearance of the undertaker and the expressman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
who at length came down the stairs with a handsome,
polished, elm coffin.</p>

<p>It contained the body of an Englishman, whose friends
were desirous of having it sent to the old country, so
that he might rest with his forefathers.</p>

<p>"Hurry with this to the <i>Umbria</i>, Charley," said the
undertaker. "Are you going along, Tommy Smithers?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, if I may."</p>

<p>"All right—up she goes."</p>

<p>The coffin was put in the wagon, and the boys got up
behind, while the driver said "Git up" to his team, and
"rattled his bones over the stones" to the Cunard docks.</p>

<p>When the steamer was reached, the steam was up, and,
as usual on such occasions, the greatest confusion prevailed.</p>

<p>The body was hoisted on deck, and the boys were permitted
on board to see it safely stowed away; but once on
the ship, they took advantage of the confusion to wander
through the ship, being hugely pleased with all they saw.</p>

<p>Suddenly a bell rang.</p>

<p>"Ship off!" cried Charley. "Make haste—this way; we
shan't get ashore if we don't look sharp."</p>

<p>Friends were taking leave of friends, and passengers
were rushing about in all directions.</p>

<p>In the crowd Tommy was separated from Charley Barker,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
and, as might have been expected, from him, he took
the wrong turning and got lost in the saloon.</p>

<p>While he was trying to find his way out the gang-plank
was drawn up, the cable slipped, and the huge ship
began steaming down the bay.</p>

<p>He had started on a voyage to England without intending
it, and could not help himself.</p>

<p>When he did reach the deck Jersey City was only visible
in the distance, and the <i>Umbria</i> was gradually leaving
the Battery behind.</p>

<p>The tears came to his eyes, and he exclaimed, "Charley!
Charley!" But his call met with no response.</p>

<p>The great ship steamed past Staten Island and into the
upper bay without anyone taking any notice of Tommy.</p>

<p>He had spoken to several people, but they, full of their
own affairs, had pushed him rudely on one side, as if a
small boy was too insignificant to pay attention to. There
was no hope of his getting on shore now, for the only
place where they might have landed him was Quarantine,
and that was out of sight.</p>

<p>The tears trickled down his face still, and a strange fear
that the captain might beat or imprison him took possession
of his mind.</p>

<p>He had heard of people being put in irons and confined
in some dark place for a trifling offense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></p>

<p>Suppose they asked him for his passage ticket, what
could he say?</p>

<p>It was not likely that the captain would take him a
journey of three thousand miles for nothing.</p>

<p>He had no money, his knowledge of the sea and of seamanship
was so meager that he did not think he could
work at anything.</p>

<p>Then, again, if they did not throw him overboard, which
he regarded as a possible contingency, what would he do
at Liverpool without a friend or a cent in the world?</p>

<p>The more he thought over the situation the more grave
did it appear.</p>

<p>He was standing nearly amidships on the side of the
rope which divides the steerage and the saloon passengers.</p>

<p>It was no use to look imploringly at people who passed
him; he was nobody's child, as it were.</p>

<p>The huge ship seemed like a town to him, it was so vast,
and held such a number of people.</p>

<p>After a while the crowd on deck decreased, as the land
receded from view, for everyone wished to put his state-room
in order, and get ready for dinner.</p>

<p>They neared the Hook, Coney Island was on the left,
and the Highlands of Navesink, vested in a blue mist,
were lying gracefully on the right.</p>

<p>A slight swell began to be perceptible in the motion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
the vessel, which showed that there was a stiff breeze and
a rising swell in the Atlantic.</p>

<p>A bell rang. The deck was soon deserted by the few
who had remained up to the last minute to enjoy the
breeze and get an appetite for dinner.</p>

<p>A lad about sixteen came up to Tommy and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Now, then, captain, you'd best be going below to get
your grub."</p>

<p>"Thank you," replied Tommy, rubbing his eyes. "I'm
not hungry, only miserable."</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>The lad was fair-haired, blue-eyed and good-natured, if
his face could be trusted, and he stared curiously at
Tommy.</p>

<p>"Are you saloon or steerage?" he asked; "because, if
you're steerage, you'll get bounced if you come this side of
that rope."</p>

<p>"I don't know what I am, and that's a fact."</p>

<p>"Come, don't guy me! Where do you belong? You
must know who you came aboard with."</p>

<p>"So I do."</p>

<p>"Who was it?"</p>

<p>"I came with the corpse," replied Tommy, with the utmost
seriousness.</p>

<p>The fair-haired lad laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span></p>

<p>"They call me Wild Charley!" he exclaimed, "and what
my other name is don't matter to anybody, since I left
home without asking permission to go; but in all my experience,
I never traveled with a corpse."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you how it was," said Tommy, eagerly. "I
live in Jersey City, next door to Barker, the undertaker,
and his boy and me was sent to this steamer with a coffined
body to go to England. We landed the stiff and
went to look around the ship, and——"</p>

<p>Wild Charley laughed.</p>

<p>"I see now," he interrupted, "you weren't quick enough
in getting on shore, and so you've started on a voyage
without having previously declared your intentions."</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>Wild Charley whistled.</p>

<p>"Indeed, what I say is true," Tommy continued, hoping
to make a favorable impression upon the first friend he
had met.</p>

<p>"I believe you," was the answer, "and I am trying to
think how I can help you. My position on board of this
ship is that of steward's assistant. If I said you were a
friend of mine whom I had engaged to assist, you could
share my bunk, do what work you could, and no one would
trouble about the bit of food you eat, so long as you kept
quiet and made yourself generally useful."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span></p>

<p>Tommy's eyes filled with tears again. This time they
were tears of gratitude.</p>

<p>Seizing Wild Charley's hand, he pressed it cordially,
saying:</p>

<p>"Oh, please do this for me. I will be so thankful."</p>

<p>"What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Tommy Smithers. They call me Soft Tommy sometimes,
because I get things kinder mixed up now and
then."</p>

<p>"I should guess you were soft when you let the ship slip
from her moorings and take you across to the other side.
Why, what on earth are you to do when you reach Liverpool?"</p>

<p>"Work my passage back, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Not so easily done as said," answered Charley. "You
don't meet with a good-natured fellow like me every day."</p>

<p>"Will you do what you can for me?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Come below. Dinner is just being served, and
it is my busy time. I'll say a few words to the purser
and chief steward, which will fix things, and all you'll
have to do will be to take the word from me and do as
you are told," answered Wild Charley.</p>

<p>They descended the hatchway, and Tommy found a job
in washing up plates and cleaning knives and forks.</p>

<p>After tea he went on deck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span></p>

<p>The sea was calm, and he did not experience any sensation
of seasickness.</p>

<p>For a while he looked over the ship's side into the
starlit night. All at once a steamer was discovered going
west.</p>

<p>The captain was on the bridge with the second officer.</p>

<p>"We'll signal that steamer," he exclaimed. "Send below
for the usual lights."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir," replied the mate.</p>

<p>He left the bridge, and, seeing Tommy, said:</p>

<p>"Are you one of the ship's boys?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Tommy, touching his cap.</p>

<p>"Go to the quartermaster, and ask him for the ordinary
signals."</p>

<p>"The what, sir?"</p>

<p>"Quartermaster, you fool! and hurry up!" shouted the
officer.</p>

<p>Tommy did not understand who the quartermaster was,
but he was afraid to ask any more questions, and dived
below.</p>

<p>The first person he met was the doctor.</p>

<p>"Please, sir," began Tommy.</p>

<p>"Well, what is it, my lad?"</p>

<p>"Where is there a quarter, master?"</p>

<p>"I've no quarter to give you, and am surprised at your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
impertinence in asking for it," the doctor answered, passing
on.</p>

<p>Tommy was somewhat surprised at this abrupt answer,
and stood still, wondering where he could go and what he
could do next, when, fortunately, he met Wild Charley.</p>

<p>"Say," he exclaimed, "where will I find the quartermaster?"</p>

<p>"That's his room," replied Wild Charley, pointing to
the right. "What do you want with him?"</p>

<p>"I'm sent for signals."</p>

<p>"Do you know what they are?"</p>

<p>"Of course I do. Don't take me for a fool," answered
Tommy, looking up with considerable pride.</p>

<p>"All right, my son. When you want to turn in, come
down to the bunk I showed you. Yours is the same as
mine."</p>

<p>"I'll be there," replied Tommy.</p>

<p>He knocked at the quartermaster's door, and was told
to enter.</p>

<p>"What is it, boy," asked the officer, without looking up
from some accounts which he was attentively studying.</p>

<p>"Captain's sent for usual signals, sir."</p>

<p>"Take them out of that locker."</p>

<p>There were two lockers, and, unfortunately, Tommy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
mistook the direction in which the quartermaster waved
his hand.</p>

<p>The consequence was that he took up two signals which
he should have left alone.</p>

<p>"Got 'em?" queried the quartermaster.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," answered Tommy, hauling off the two lights.</p>

<p>"Get along, then."</p>

</div>

<p class="center">THE WRONG SIGNALS.</p>


<p>Tommy lost no time in getting on deck, and reaching
the bridge, found that the third officer was in charge, the
captain and the second officer having retired to the cabin
of the former to consult the chart as to some questions
in dispute between them.</p>

<p>"Give me those lights," exclaimed the third officer, who
had been instructed to burn them.</p>

<p>They were handed over, and at once sent up.</p>

<p>Bright and brilliant they shot up, and flashed in the
clear, dark blue sky.</p>

<p>Scarcely had they died away when the captain returned
and took his place on the bridge.</p>

<p>"Signaled her, Mr. Simmons?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the third officer.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he spoken when an answering signal appeared
shooting up from the deck of the passing steamer.</p>

<p>"By jingo! that's queer," said the captain.</p>

<p>"Very strange, indeed, sir," replied the third officer.</p>

<p>"What do you understand by that?"</p>

<p>"It's heave to, or I'm mistaken; but, really, I don't understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
the whole code as well as I ought. I must take
the book in hand."</p>

<p>"See, she's altering her course. We'll show our ensign,
and alter the ship's course a few points to the northwest."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, sir."</p>

<p>The necessary change was made, and the two steamers
approached each other.</p>

<p>When they got within hailing distance a voice shouted:</p>

<p>"Ship ahoy!"</p>

<p>"<i>Umbria</i>," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Where from, and how long out?"</p>

<p>"New York, six hours."</p>

<p>"What in thunder," was the next question, "do you
want to fool us by signaling that you were in distress and
out of provisions?"</p>

<p>"We sent up the ordinary signals, to make out who
you were."</p>

<p>"Some mistake. Do you want anything?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then good-by. We're the <i>Asia</i>, and we'll have a good
joke on you."</p>

<p>The captain of the <i>Umbria</i> muttered some improper
words, and gave the order to go ahead.</p>

<p>Soon the mighty machinery began to creak and groan,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
and the good ship was speedily flying across the ocean at
the rate of sixteen knots.</p>

<p>The vessels parted, their lights grew dim in the distance,
and the captain had full leisure to vent his displeasure
upon those who deserved it.</p>

<p>He sought the quartermaster, who was still busy in his
cabin.</p>

<p>"Why did you send me the wrong signals?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I pointed to the locker, sir, and told the boy to help
himself. He must have mistaken the lights."</p>

<p>"Yes, and a nice laughingstock he has made of us."</p>

<p>"What did you send up, sir?"</p>

<p>"In distress and short of provisions, when we were
only six hours from port."</p>

<p>The quartermaster with difficulty repressed a smile.</p>

<p>"Who burned the lights?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"The third officer, and it's my opinion that none of the
men on board this boat know their business," quoth the
captain.</p>

<p>With this severe shot he went on deck again, and sent
the boatswain to find out Tommy.</p>

<p>"When you've got him," he added, "give him the taste
of a rope's-end, to make him smarter in future."</p>

<p>Luckily for Tommy, the boatswain was unable to find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
him, as he had, on seeing that something was wrong,
gone below and got into his berth.</p>

<p>But again he had made a mistake, for in the darkness
he had entered the purser's cabin, and got into his bed.</p>

<p>The purser had been playing a game of whist in the
smoking room and drinking some hot whisky, which, with
the fatigue of the day, consequent on leaving port, made
him feel unusually sleepy.</p>

<p>Kicking off his boots, he turned into his bunk without
looking inside, and was greatly surprised to find it occupied.</p>

<p>"Oh! Charley," exclaimed Tommy, "ain't you heavy.
Get off me, or you'll have me smothered, sure."</p>

<p>The purser sprang out again and took one look at the
bold intruder.</p>

<p>"You young cub!" he cried, "come out of that double-quick,
or I'll skin you alive!"</p>

<p>"Ain't it Charley?"</p>

<p>"No, it's me. How dare you have the cheek to turn into
my bunk? Clear out!"</p>

<p>Tommy made a snatch for his clothes, and got out.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, sir, but where do I sleep?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Hang me if I know, and I'm blessed if I care," replied
the purser. "Take your hook out of this, youngster."</p>

<p>Tommy attempted to run, but a well-directed kick from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
the purser sent him on his hands and knees, when the
door was banged behind him.</p>

<p>"Bounced!" he heard a voice say close to him.</p>

<p>"That's sure as I'm alive, and badly bounced, too.
Why, Charley, is that you?"</p>

<p>"It is. What's up?"</p>

<p>"I'm down," replied Tommy. "The fact is, I got into
the wrong cabin, and was yanked out."</p>

<p>"You're always making mistakes. It's rough on you,
I'll admit, but it serves you right."</p>

<p>They turned in after this, and the next day very little
was seen of Tommy, as the weather was very rough, and
he was so seasick he kept in his berth.</p>

<p>The gale was over in a couple of days, and he appeared
again, serene and smiling, having found his sea
legs, as his friend, Wild Charley, expressed it.</p>

<p>The boatswain's pipes whistled cheerily at this moment.</p>

<p>Some sailors were climbing up the shrouds.</p>

<p>"Anything I can do, sir?" inquired Tommy.</p>

<p>"Go aloft and help set that sail," was the reply.</p>

<p>Though he had never been in the rigging before,
Tommy was too proud to refuse to comply with this command.</p>

<p>Accordingly he shinned up the shrouds, but hadn't gone
far before he lost his hold and fell in a lump to the deck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span></p>

<p>He would have seriously injured himself had not the
officer been standing directly under him.</p>

<p>Tommy fell upon the officer's broad back, bringing him
with a thud to the deck.</p>

<p>He jumped up unhurt, but the officer was much bruised
and shaken.</p>

<p>"Deuce take you for a fool!" he cried.</p>

<p>"Anything else I can do, sir?" asked Tommy.</p>

<p>The officer rose and picked up a belaying pin.</p>

<p>"If you don't make yourself scarce," he replied, "I'll
pound you into a jelly."</p>

<p>Tommy disappeared below, but the men had seen the
fall and heard Tommy's remark of "anything else I can
do, sir?" which became quite a word in the forecastle during
the remainder of the voyage.</p>

<p>During the rest of the morning he was sent by the
steward to wait upon the cabin passengers, and answer
the smoking-room bell.</p>

<p>The ladies kept him busy carrying up wraps and chairs,
as it was fine on deck, and the gentlemen occupied his
time in orders for Bass' ale and cigars.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nathan S. Stocker, of Chicago, had a mortal
aversion to a dog, and a maiden lady named Jones had a
Scotch terrier which she insisted upon giving all the
privileges of the saloon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span></p>

<p>The two ladies entered the saloon together as Tommy
was dusting the piano.</p>

<p>Miss Jones' dog ran up and pawed her.</p>

<p>"Boy!" exclaimed Mrs. Stocker, "remove this animal."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am."</p>

<p>"Touch him if you dare! Dogs have as much right
here as children," replied Miss Jones.</p>

<p>"That remark does not apply to me, as I have left all
my precious ones at home; but I will maintain that the
butcher's shop is the place for dogs. Boy, go to the
purser, and say that I wish this brute taken away."</p>

<p>"Certainly, ma'am," answered Tommy.</p>

<p>The ladies glared at one another, and Tommy sought
the purser, who was in his cabin.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you want?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Say, sir, what am I to do with Miss Jones' dog? Mrs.
Stocker says——"</p>

<p>"Oh! hang the dog!" replied the purser, impatiently.
"I've heard all that before. I can't be bothered."</p>

<p>Tommy entered the saloon again with a piece of rope.</p>

<p>"What does he say?" asked Mrs. Stocker, eagerly.</p>

<p>"The dog's to be hanged, ma'am."</p>

<p>"What!" cried Miss Jones, "hang my Fido!"</p>

<p>"I always said the purser was a gentleman," remarked
Mrs. Stocker, smiling triumphantly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>"I will appeal to the captain!" exclaimed Miss Jones.
"Touch Fido, if you dare, till I return."</p>

<p>She rushed away, and Tommy stood, irresolute how
to act.</p>

<p>"Boy," said Mrs. Stocker, "carry out the purser's orders.
Execute that detestable brute of a dog, and I will
never forget you."</p>

<p>"All right, ma'am," answered Tommy.</p>

<p>He put the dog under his arm, and going on deck,
slung the rope over a yard, made a noose, and having put
it round the dog's neck, hauled him up about two feet
from the deck.</p>

<p>Fido struggled and kicked, and his eyes were nearly
starting from his head in all the agony of strangulation.</p>

<p>Suddenly Miss Jones, followed by the captain, rushed
upon the scene, wringing her hands and uttering piercing
cries.</p>

<p>"My dear, dear Fido! Save him! oh, save him!" she
exclaimed, in piteous accents.</p>

<p>The captain took out a claspknife and cut the rope; then
he gave Tommy a box on the ear.</p>

<p>Consequently Fido fell on the deck, very much resembling
a dead dog, and his executioner tumbled in a heap
on top of him.</p>

<p>Miss Jones pulled him off, and taking up her dear dog,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
hugged it in her arms, being rewarded by a feeble wag of
the tail.</p>

<p>"He lives! yes, he breathes! I was in time!" she cried,
tragically, "and my darling is saved!"</p>

<p>The captain looked sternly at Tommy.</p>

<p>"Who gave you authority to hang people's dogs?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"Purser's orders, sir," answered Tommy.</p>

<p>The purser chanced to come on deck, and was just
about offering his arm to a lady who was taking a promenade,
when the captain called him.</p>

<p>"Why did you order this lady's dog to be killed, Mr.
Kinsey?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I, sir? I did nothing of the sort," replied the purser.</p>

<p>"This boy says you did."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, sir. Don't go back on me!" pleaded
Tommy. "You said, 'Hang the dog!'"</p>

<p>"But I didn't mean it that way, you fool! It was an
exclamation of impatience. I had heard of this dog
trouble, and didn't want to be mixed up in it."</p>

<p>"Take the dog to the butcher, and let him mind him
until the end of the voyage."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Madam, I am glad to have been of service to you,"<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
continued the captain, making a polite bow to Miss Jones
and going on the bridge.</p>

<p>Tommy took the dog to the butcher and received a severe
talking to from the purser, who said:</p>

<p>"Are you a fool, or are you putting on?"</p>

<p>"Really, sir, I thought that you were in earnest."</p>

<p>"Thought my eye! thought my grandmother!" replied
the purser. "If I thought you were trying on any more
larks with me, I'd tan your hide, my lad, and don't you
forget it!"</p>

<p>Tommy shrank away, somewhat abashed, wondering
why people would say what they didn't mean.</p>

<p>But he had made a friend of Mrs. Stocker, who in the
end proved of great service to him.</p>

<p class="center">THE SMUGGLER.</p>


<p>The voyage was a quick one, and on the morning of
the ninth day out they were in the River Mersey.</p>

<p>Wild Charley spoke to him in the morning, and asked
him what he intended to do.</p>

<p>"I don't know, exactly," answered Tommy. "At first
I was anxious to get home, but if I write a letter to
mother, telling her I am safe and well, she will not be
anxious about me, and now I am here I should like to see
something of England."</p>

<p>"Spoken like a little man," said Wild Charley. "I have
spoken to the steward, and he says he will always give
you a passage back to America."</p>

<p>"That's good, and I'm much obliged to you."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Stocker has also mentioned your name," continued
Charley. "She is grateful to you for that affair
of Miss Jones' dog."</p>

<p>"Yes, she said she'd be a friend to me."</p>

<p>"If you like to be her attendant and look after her
baggage, she says she will take you along."</p>

<p>"That will suit me first rate."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>

<p>"Very well. You can see her at the Adelphi Hotel,
where she stays three days; but at present I want you to
do something for me."</p>

<p>"You have only to name it. I'm sure, after your kindness,
there is nothing I could refuse you," replied Tommy,
warmly.</p>

<p>"It is a mere trifle. I've got a lot of tobacco in cakes,
which I would like to have you conceal about your body."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"To avoid paying duty to the custom house," replied
Wild Charley.</p>

<p>"That would be smuggling."</p>

<p>"Of course it would, but there is no harm in it."</p>

<p>"It's against the laws, and if I'm found out I shall be
put in prison for it."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," replied Charley, "there is no harm in it.
They're not very strict, and if you were tumbled to, I
should be the principal sufferer."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I should lose all my tobacco, which would be
forfeited to the customs."</p>

<p>Tommy hesitated.</p>

<p>Looking critically at him with his keen, selfish, blue
eyes, Charley added:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>"I didn't think you would make any difficulty about
such a little thing after the friend I've been to you."</p>

<p>"But——"</p>

<p>"Oh, if you're so awful mean, say no more about it.
I'm tired of roughing it, and intend to go home. My only
idea in smuggling the tobacco was that I should have a
little spending money when I reached home, and not look
poor."</p>

<p>"Are your friends well off?"</p>

<p>"Tolerably. Father is a professor, and keeps quite a
fashionable boarding school for young gentlemen in London."</p>

<p>"And you mean to go back?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I'll return to Greek and algebra, and learn all
I can. Seeing the world is all very well, but it doesn't
pay when you can do better at home," answered Wild
Charley.</p>

<p>"That's so," answered Tommy, still hesitating.</p>

<p>"Come, don't keep me waiting for your reply all day.
Say yes or no," answered Wild Charley, impatiently.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Tommy had consented in his soft way to do what his
better judgment told him might get him into trouble.</p>

<p>Lest he should have time for his decision to cool, he was
called by Charley into their cabin and literally stuffed with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
bags containing thin, flat cakes of tightly pressed tobacco.</p>

<p>The duty on this tobacco is four shillings and six pence
per pound, with five per cent. added, and when we say
that Tommy was loaded or padded with over half a hundredweight,
it can be imagined that he was smuggling on
a large scale.</p>

<p>Wild Charley sewed the bags with a needle and thread
to the lining of his pants, vest and coat, giving him a
large pilot jacket to wear over all.</p>

<p>"Now," he said, "you'll do. We shall soon be off
Birkenhead, when the officers of the customs will come
on board. All you have to do is to loaf around here, and
when we've landed our passengers, you and I will go
ashore together, and I'll take you to a friend of mine,
where you can unload your cargo."</p>

<p>"All right," replied Tommy.</p>

<p>"If anything should go wrong you won't squeal?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Promise me that, because if they do twig you, they'll
ask you all sorts of questions, and it will do you no good
to give me away. There are more in the thing than myself,
and you'll have a present given you."</p>

<p>"I promise," replied Tommy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span></p>

<p>He remained below, showing himself as little as possible,
until the steamer was boarded by the custom house
officers.</p>

<p>It did not then occur to him that his friend, Wild Charley,
was as heartless as he was full of scheming.</p>

<p>Yet it was a fact that he had only made up his mind
to befriend him because he thought he would be of great
assistance in his smuggling venture, in which some of the
steward's assistants were mixed up.</p>

<p>The revenue men had been all over the ship, and Wild
Charley had looked in upon Tommy, whispering that he
guessed it was all right now.</p>

<p>Tommy accordingly went into the saloon to see if he
could not pick up a dollar by making himself of use to
some of the passengers, who were getting their smaller
articles of baggage together preparatory to quitting the
vessel.</p>

<p>The first party he encountered was Mr. and Mrs.
Nathan D. Stocker, of Chicago.</p>

<p>"Anything I can do, ma'am?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well, yes, take a hold of this valise and these wraps.
But, gracious sakes! how you've grown," she replied.</p>

<p>"Got a little fatter," said Tommy, coloring up.</p>

<p>He was not aware that he presented the appearance of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
a prize side show boy, and had increased apparently at
least one-third in size.</p>

<p>"Why, bless me!" remarked Mr. Stocker, "the boy is
positively bloated—swelled up like the frog in the fable.
I never saw such a thing. Chicawgo growed fast after
the fire, but, by thunder, he licks Chicawgo hollow!"</p>

<p>"It's being confined and shut up on board ship," said
Tommy.</p>

<p>"You've been living high, bub."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I guess that's got something to do with it."</p>

<p>A man who was writing at a table in the saloon heard
this conversation, and got up.</p>

<p>Tommy had the valise in one hand, and the wraps were
thrown over his arm.</p>

<p>"Put those down," said the man.</p>

<p>Mrs. Stocker looked at him.</p>

<p>"Why should he? They are mine!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I am perfectly well aware of that fact, madam," replied
the man, "and feel sorry to interfere with your arrangements
in any way, but I am a custom house officer."</p>

<p>"Indeed?"</p>

<p>"I feel it my duty to examine this boy, because such an
extraordinary growth as you hinted at does not seem
natural."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span></p>

<p>Tommy felt as if he would like to sink into his boots.</p>

<p>If the floor had opened and allowed him to drop down
into the hold or into the sea, it would have been a welcome
relief.</p>

<p>"Take off that pilot coat," continued the revenue man.</p>

<p>"Why should I do that?" asked Tommy.</p>

<p>"If you don't do it, I'll have to help you."</p>

<p>Reluctantly Tommy obeyed.</p>

<p>"Now remove the other."</p>

<p>He did so.</p>

<p>The officer laid it on the table, and the bags of tobacco
were revealed to view.</p>

<p>Passing his hands up and down the boy's vest and
pants, the officer smiled serenely.</p>

<p>"Decided case of smuggling!" he exclaimed, triumphantly.
"I'll have to arrest you. Put on your coats,
and, when we land, come with me before a magistrate."</p>

<p>"Oh, please, sir, don't do that. Take the stuff and let
me go," pleaded Tommy.</p>

<p>"Can't do it."</p>

<p>"I—I'm very sorry."</p>

<p>"I'm not. This is a good haul. We have suspected
that there has been a great deal of smuggled tobacco<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
taken off these ocean steamers, and I'm pleased to think
we've spotted some one at last."</p>

<p>Tommy began to cry.</p>

<p>"Who is in this with you?" asked the officer.</p>

<p>"N—no one, sir," replied Tommy.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Qui-quite sure, sir."</p>

<p>"All right. Tell a lie and stick to it. We've got you,
and that's enough for me," answered the officer.</p>

<p>Tommy continued crying, and rubbed the knuckles of
his hands in his eyes, but nobody took any notice of him.</p>

<p>All were busily engaged in preparing to leave the vessel,
and when she presently reached her dock, a grand
rush was made for the gangway.</p>

<p>"Won't you let me go?" asked Tommy, thinking the
officer might relent.</p>

<p>"Not likely," was the reply.</p>

<p>"What will they do with me?"</p>

<p>"Send you up for life, or perhaps hang you."</p>

<p>At this appalling prospect, which was a jest of the
officer, Tommy's tears redoubled. Mr. and Mrs. Stocker
bestowed no attention upon the unhappy boy, and even
Wild Charley, who caught sight of him in charge of the
officer, hurried on as quick as he could.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>

<p>"Charley! Charley!" exclaimed Tommy.</p>

<p>But Charley ran as if his former acquaintance were
stricken with the plague.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" asked the custom house officer.</p>

<p>"Only a friend of mine, sir," rejoined Tommy.</p>

<p>Soon afterward Tommy was taken on shore, and
brought up before the nearest magistrate.</p>

<p>The case was stated, and the smuggled tobacco produced.</p>

<p>"Clear case," said the judge. "Had he any accomplices?"</p>

<p>"He says not, your worship," replied the officer.</p>

<p>"Well, as he is so young, we will fine him twenty
pounds, or three months in jail."</p>

<p>"I haven't a cent, sir," exclaimed Tommy, "nor a
friend on this side."</p>

<p>"Sorry for you. Next case!" replied the judge.</p>

<p>Tommy was taken below to the cells of the jailer, to
await the coming of the van which was to take him to
prison.</p>

<p>Pushed rudely in, and locked up, he felt very miserable;
but he could do nothing.</p>

<p>He was alone and friendless, as well as penniless,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
while even Wild Charley, who might have been expected
to help him, kept away.</p>

<p>Abandoned on all sides, Tommy gave himself up to
despair, and sat on the hard bench in his cell in a state
of sullen despondency.</p>

<p class="center">LOST IN LONDON.</p>


<p>Very miserably passed the sluggish hours for Tommy.
It was now afternoon, and he had been locked up more
than two hours, during which he had indulged in a
good cry.</p>

<p>He was looking forward to the arrival of the van
which was to take him and others similarly situated to
jail, when the wicket in his cell door was pushed back.
The face of the jailer appeared at the aperture.</p>

<p>"Johnny," he exclaimed, "brace up. Here's two people
wants to see you."</p>

<p>"Who are they?" eagerly demanded Tommy.</p>

<p>"How should I know? They look like swells, though,
and are dressed bang up. The lady gave me a shilling."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" said Tommy. "Show them in at once.
This isn't New Year's, but I'm receiving calls."</p>

<p>The door was flung open, and Mr. and Mrs. Stocker
appeared in the damp, narrow passageway.</p>

<p>"What an awful place," exclaimed Mrs. Stocker. "Is
this where they put smugglers? I declare that I'll never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
risk taking any more silks or laces in my trunks when
I go back to the States."</p>

<p>"It's for all sorts, ma'am," answered the jailer.</p>

<p>Tommy looked at Mr. Stocker and wished him
good-day.</p>

<p>"You've got yourself in a nice fix," said the Chicago
man, "and if I'd thought you'd done it all yourself I
wouldn't have helped you, but my wife thinks it's a put-up
job, and she wants me to pay the fine for you, though
a hundred dollars is a lot of money, and if you travel
with us, you mustn't expect much wages for some time
to come."</p>

<p>"I won't ask a cent, sir," replied Tommy, "if you'll
only get me out of this place."</p>

<p>"Who was it?" asked Mrs. Stocker.</p>

<p>"It was Wild Charley, ma'am, that got me to do it."</p>

<p>"That steward's assistant. Sakes! Why didn't you
tell the judge so? Good land! I'd have turned the tables
on him mighty quick."</p>

<p>"He made me promise not to."</p>

<p>"Well," said Mr. Stocker, taking a chew of short-cut,
"I'll allow that you were soft not to squeal on him, but
I guess I'll have to buy you out of this hole. It goes
against the grain of my wood to see an American citizen
shut up for smuggling a bit of tobacco."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>Overwhelmed with delight, Tommy was marched upstairs
by the jailer. The fine was paid, and instead of
going to prison, he accompanied Mr. and Mrs. Stocker
to their hotel.</p>

<p>He was engaged by them to look after the baggage
and attend upon the lady, who hated foreigners, and
said she would rather have one of her own countrymen
around her than an Englishman or a Frenchman.</p>

<p>The next day was spent in viewing the sights of Liverpool,
and at five o'clock they took the express train to go
to London.</p>

<p>On arriving at the railway station, Tommy was quite
bewildered at the noise and bustle which prevailed on
all sides of him.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Stocker hired two cabs, as one would
not contain all their baggage, which they had packed
on the roof of the cab, putting the smaller parcels inside.</p>

<p>They were to ride in one and Tommy in the other.</p>

<p>"Give me those wraps—hurry up! Oh, my, how cold
it is!" cried Mrs. Stocker. "I shall be so glad when I
get to the hotel."</p>

<p>The weather had changed considerably within the last
twelve hours, a light snow was falling.</p>

<p>Tommy handed in the wraps through the window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span></p>

<p>"Did you tell them drivers where to go, sir?" asked
Tommy.</p>

<p>"Yes. Jump in and keep behind us," was the reply.</p>

<p>Now it happened that there were many cabs in the
station, and most of them were laden with luggage, so
that it was difficult to tell one from the other.</p>

<p>People were rushing about hither and thither, porters
were wheeling trunks on barrows, and pushing all out
of their way.</p>

<p>A hand truck went over Tommy's foot, which made
him set up a howl of pain.</p>

<p>Scarcely had this happened than he was caught in a
rush of people and carried halfway down the platform.</p>

<p>Having got out of this crush, he retraced his steps
and tried to find out his cab, but as all the four-wheeled
London cabs resemble each other, it was not an easy
task.</p>

<p>At length he fancied he had found the right one, and
opening the door, got in.</p>

<p>"Go on," said he.</p>

<p>The driver, however, got down from his box, and
eying the boy sternly through the window, replied:</p>

<p>"Who are you tellin' to go on?"</p>

<p>"Why, you, of course."</p>

<p>"Did you engage me?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>"I didn't hire you, but my boss did," replied Tommy,
"and he told you where to go to."</p>

<p>"Where's that?"</p>

<p>Tommy scratched his head in perplexity.</p>

<p>He had heard the name of the hotel, but the rush, the
whirl, and the bustle of the moment had driven it clean
out of his head.</p>

<p>"I've forgotten!" he exclaimed. "But it don't matter
so long as the boss told you, and you know."</p>

<p>"Look here, young fellow," replied the cabman, "this
game won't wash. I never see you before, and I don't
know nothing about bosses. You get out."</p>

<p>"What d'you mean?" cried Tommy, "ain't the trunks
got the name of Stocker on them?"</p>

<p>"No, they haven't. It's name of Jones. See for yourself."</p>

<p>"I'll stay here," answered Tommy.</p>

<p>"Will you?"</p>

<p>"You bet I will. It's my opinion you want to steal
the property."</p>

<p>This insinuation was more than the man could bear.</p>

<p>He stretched out his arm, seized Tommy by the collar,
and dragging him out, flung him on the platform, where
he fell on his back.</p>

<p>At that moment the gentleman who had in reality engaged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
the cab appeared with his wife, got in, and was
driven off.</p>

<p>Tommy, still of opinion that the cab held Mr. Stocker's
property, ran after it out of the station, but it went
quicker than he, so that he soon lost sight of it in the
blinding snow.</p>

<p>Thus died away his last hope.</p>

<p>He had lost all trace of his kind protectors, and it
seemed as if it was impossible to find them again.</p>

<p>How could he gain any news of them in such a vast
wilderness as London?</p>

<p>The snow was descending in thick, heavy flakes.</p>

<p>Where could he go for shelter?</p>

<p>In his pocket he had not a cent, and he did not know
anyone in the whole metropolis.</p>

<p>With a terrible dread of starvation, or being frozen
to death, he leaned against a lamp-post.</p>

<p>Suddenly a policeman came upon him.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" he asked, roughly.</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied Tommy.</p>

<p>"Move on."</p>

<p>"I've nowhere to go to. I'm a stranger here, and——"</p>

<p>"Go to the workhouse," interrupted the policeman.</p>

<p>"I don't know where it is."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>"Then I ain't going to tell you. All I know is, if you
don't get off my beat, I'll have to make you."</p>

<p>With a weary sigh Tommy trudged on in the rapidly
deepening snow.</p>

<p>He was so tired that he scarcely could drag one leg
after the other, and seeing a door standing half open, he
determined to enter and throw himself on the mercy of
the inmates.</p>

<p>Over the door was a lamp, and on the door a brass
plate, upon which was engraved, "Rev. C. Floyd, Academy
for Young Gentlemen."</p>

<p>In the hallway he met an elderly lady, who had no
sooner seen him that she began to cry out at the top of
her voice:</p>

<p>"Thieves! murder! burglars! help!"</p>

<p>A gentleman of clerical appearance came out of a
room, and behind him were a dozen or more boys.</p>

<p>These he waved back with his hand, saying:</p>

<p>"No excitement, if you please, young gentlemen. Stay
where you are."</p>

<p>The boys hesitated on the threshold, looking over one
another's shoulders, those in the rear standing on tiptoe.</p>

<p>"Now, my dear," commenced the clerical-looking gentleman,
who was the Rev. C. Floyd himself, "what is
the matter?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span></p>

<p>"A stranger in the house," replied Mrs. Floyd.</p>

<p>"Indeed!"</p>

<p>The Rev. C. Floyd adjusted his spectacles, and looked
curiously at Tommy.</p>

<p>"My boy!" he exclaimed, "what do you want here at
this hour of the evening?"</p>

<p>"If you please, sir," replied Tommy, "I'm a stranger
here. I'm lost, and I thought you might allow me to
sleep somewhere till morning."</p>

<p>"Have you no home?"</p>

<p>"Not here. I'm from America, and only came up from
Liverpool to-day."</p>

<p>"Dear me," said the Rev. C. Floyd. "That is a curious
coincidence. My son only arrived yesterday. You
say you are from America. Now we will test the accuracy
of your story. Perhaps you are an impostor. If
so, you will be turned out; if not, you shall receive
shelter."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," answered Tommy, peeping curiously
at the young gentlemen on the threshold.</p>

<p>"Mary, my dear," exclaimed the Rev. C. Floyd, "will
you kindly call down our prodigal son, who, I have reason
to believe, is smoking a pipe in his bedroom, contrary
to my express orders."</p>

<p>Mrs. Floyd, having recovered from her fright at seeing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
a stranger in the house, went upstairs, and presently
returned with a young man.</p>

<p>Tommy's eyes dilated with surprise.</p>

<p>"Charley!" he exclaimed—"Wild Charley! He knows
me, sir. We came over in the same ship together."</p>

<p>The young man advanced with a smile, and held out
his hand.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you," he said; "I thought you had found
a job in Liverpool."—This was said with an expressive
wink.—"But how did you find me?"</p>

<p>"Chance," replied Tommy.</p>

<p>Rev. C. Floyd looked from one to the other.</p>

<p>"Do I understand that you two were shipmates?" he
asked; "and that you have met here quite accidentally?"</p>

<p>"That's so, father," answered Charley. "Let Tommy
come in by the stove and he'll tell you all about it."</p>

<p class="center">TOMMY IN BUTTONS.</p>


<p>Tommy was invited in, and given a seat. He related
his adventures, but owing to a whisper from Wild
Charley, did not say anything about the smuggling.
They all listened to him with great attention, and admitted
that his coming to Mr. Floyd's was very remarkable.</p>

<p>"My young friend," exclaimed Rev. C. Floyd, "your
wanderings serve to show that there is a higher power
which watches over the most insignificant of us. I will
turn no houseless wanderer from my door; nay, I will
even offer you employment."</p>

<p>"How can I thank you, sir?" said Tommy, his eyes
overflowing with tears.</p>

<p>"By diligence and civility. We have a lad named
Bobsey, who cleans the boots and shoes, sees to the
fires, brushes the young gentlemen's clothes, and answers
the bell, as well as waits at table."</p>

<p>"I'll do that."</p>

<p>"Bobsey is about to leave us. You shall take his
place, receive your board and lodging, and half a crown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
a month. I think, my dear, that Bobsey's livery will fit
our young friend."</p>

<p>"Yes; they're about the same size," answered Mrs.
Floyd, to whom this remark was addressed.</p>

<p>"Then we will relegate him to the regions below; for
though he has traveled with our Charley, their intimacy
must cease, and Tommy be taught at the start that we
can allow no communication between him and our young
gentlemen."</p>

<p>At this, the young gentlemen in question, who were
inclined to be priggish and high-toned, turned up their
noses and appeared to regard Tommy as one very much
beneath them.</p>

<p>"Boy," exclaimed Mrs. Floyd, "go downstairs, and the
cook will give you your supper. For to-night you will
sleep with Bobsey."</p>

<p>"Thank you, ma'am," replied Tommy.</p>

<p>She conducted him to the top of the kitchen stair, and
called down to the cook, saying:</p>

<p>"Susan, this is the new page boy."</p>

<p>"All right, ma'am," answered the cook from the depths
below.</p>

<p>Tommy went down and entered a large kitchen in
which burned a bright fire. The cook, a good-natured
looking woman, sat on one side, and on the other, perched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
upon a stool, was a lad of sixteen, though his face was
old enough to make one think he was twice that age.</p>

<p>"Bobsey," said the cook, "missis says this is the new
page boy."</p>

<p>"I knows it," replied Bobsey, with a cheerful air.
"Cos vy, I vos a-listenin' at the door all the time they
vos a-talkin', and it don't break my 'art. Look at me!
Ven I come 'ere I vos fat, now I is that thin my mother
thinks of chalkin' my 'ed and lettin' me hout as a billiard
cue."</p>

<p>"I'm sure, Bobsey, you 'as plenty to heat and to drink,"
answered the cook, with a reproachful glance.</p>

<p>"It isn't you I's complaining of, cooky," rejoined Bobsey;
"it's the vork. If a cove vants to go for to commit
suicide vell, hall he 'as to do is to take a place in a
academy for young gentlemen. Sit down, my noble
swell from furrin' parts; we hain't a-goin' to heat you,
and I don't bear no malice agin' anyone."</p>

<p>Tommy took a seat between the two.</p>

<p>There was a ring at the bell.</p>

<p>"Vot is that bell a-ringing for?" said Bobsey.
"They've got a scuttle of coal in the schoolroom; ditto
in the parlor; the young gentlemen 'as 'ad their supper,
and the ole woman has got some 'ot water for her nightcap."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

<p>"What does she want hot water for her nightcap for?"
asked Tommy.</p>

<p>"She takes a little gin 'ot before she goes to bed."</p>

<p>"Shall I answer the bell?"</p>

<p>"If you don't, I shan't," replied Bobsey; "as you're
engaged, I may consider myself on leave of habsence—eh,
cooky?"</p>

<p>"Of course," replied Susan. "Servants have their
rights, and who'd blame you, Bobsey?"</p>

<p>"You hadmire my spirit, cooky?"</p>

<p>"Indeed I do."</p>

<p>Bobsey got up and removed a coat he wore, made of
blue cloth and ornamented in the front with bright silver-colored
buttons.</p>

<p>"Take the badge of servitude!" he exclaimed. "I discard
it. Cos vy? Not cos I'm sacked, but I've got a
hindependent spirit which vill never be satisfied till the
earth of this country runs red with the blood of the haristocrats."</p>

<p>Susan regarded Bobsey with admiration not unmixed
with awe.</p>

<p>"Don't he talk beautiful?" she said.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Tommy.</p>

<p>"'Ow is it in the Hunited States?" inquired Bobsey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span></p>

<p>"Very much the same as it is here," replied Tommy;
"we've all got to work."</p>

<p>"Hain't you hall masters and no servants?"</p>

<p>"Not exactly. One man considers himself as good as
another, but's a mighty hard place for working and finding
your level."</p>

<p>The bell rang again.</p>

<p>"Put on the badge," said Bobsey. "I'll take it heasy."</p>

<p>With some difficulty Tommy got into the coat, which
was several sizes too small for him, and only by dint of
holding his breath could he get the buttons to go into
the holes prepared for them.</p>

<p>He felt that if he was compelled to undergo any unusual
exertion, the buttons would fly off like bullets from
a rifle when the trigger falls.</p>

<p>"Shall I do?" he asked.</p>

<p>"First-rate," replied Bobsey. "You looks a A No. 1
Buttons, and no mistake."</p>

<p>Tommy hastened upstairs to answer the ringing of the
bell, which summoned him to the parlor where Mr. and
Mrs. Floyd were seated, the young gentlemen being in the
schoolroom indulging in half an hour's conversational
recreation before prayers, which preceded their retirement
to their dormitories.</p>

<p>Entering the parlor, he inquired:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span></p>

<p>"Did you ring, sir?"</p>

<p>"Ah—h'm," replied the Rev. C. Floyd. "This is very
good. He'll do, my dear; I think, though, the coat is a
little tight for him. Yes, I did ring. You are putting
too much coal on the fire downstairs. It makes our chimney
smoke."</p>

<p>"I wish he could stop our chimney; the nasty thing
chokes me," remarked Mrs. Floyd.</p>

<p>"I'll see what can be done," answered Tommy.</p>

<p>He went into the kitchen again, but missed a step on
the stairs and fell in a heap at the bottom, but without
hurting himself.</p>

<p>"Vot's that?" cried Bobsey, coming out.</p>

<p>"I missed my pitch," replied Tommy. "Blame these
stairs!"</p>

<p>"No bones broke, eh? and no damage done?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no."</p>

<p>"That's good. Yes, there is, though—you've busted
some buttons. I knowed as 'ow you'd bust yer buttons."</p>

<p>Tommy looked at what Bobsey called the "badge," and
saw that several buttons were missing.</p>

<p>"They'll have to buy you a new one," said Bobsey, consolingly.
"Vell, vot did the old duffer want?"</p>

<p>"His chimney smokes, and they want me to stop it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span></p>

<p>Bobsey's eyes twinkled with a delight he could not
conceal.</p>

<p>"Oh," he said, "that's an old dodge. Did he tell you
what to do?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"He left it to me, I suppose. I always had to do it."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"You've got to take the hall doormat and get up to the
top of the house; there's a trapdoor at the top—get out
of that, and put the doormat on the top of the chimney.
I'll show you."</p>

<p>"Is that what he calls stopping the chimney?"</p>

<p>"If that won't do it, I want to know what will," replied
Bobsey.</p>

<p>"That settles it," said Tommy. "I want to do all I
can to please them, as they were kind enough to take me
in out of the snow."</p>

<p>"Of course; you're tender hearted. Come along."</p>

<p>Tommy followed Bobsey, who pointed to a heavy mat
in the hall, which Tommy slung over his shoulder, and
they proceeded to the top of the house, where a step-ladder
gave egress to the roof through a trapdoor, which
was easily opened.</p>

<p>The chimney was close to the trap, and without any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
great exertion Tommy managed to place the mat over it,
precluding the possibility of any smoke escaping.</p>

<p>When this was done, Bobsey hurried him downstairs
again into the kitchen.</p>

<p>"I don't want any gratitude," he remarked, "for putting
you up to things and making you know the ways of the
'ouse."</p>

<p>"I'm a thousand times obliged to you," replied Tommy,
"for keeping me posted."</p>

<p>"I may help you a hundred different ways, but never
you tell anyone who it was done it."</p>

<p>"Not I. What do you take me for?" said Tommy.
"I'm no slouch."</p>

<p>The bell of the parlor began to ring again furiously,
and Tommy prepared to answer it.</p>

<p>"The old duffer wants to thank you," remarked Bobsey.
"If he hoffers to make you a present of 'alf a crown,
don't you say no."</p>

<p class="center">AN ARTISTIC CHIMNEY SWEEPING.</p>


<p>Tommy hastened upstairs, and Bobsey, entering the
kitchen, made various pantomimic expressions of delight,
such as inflating his cheeks, putting out his tongue, winking
one eye and setting his fingers to his nose.</p>

<p>"Oh, my," he cried to the cook, "ain't he soft? I'm
glad I ain't going far away from this place, 'cos I can
'ave no end of fun with 'im."</p>

<p>"What you done now?" asked Susan.</p>

<p>"You'll hear the racket, if you listen at the foot of the
stairs," replied Bobsey.</p>

<p>They both adjourned to the spot mentioned, and
eagerly listened to what was taking place above.</p>

<p>When Tommy entered the Rev. C. Floyd's room he
found it full of thick coal smoke, which was pouring in
dense volumes from the blocked-up chimney.</p>

<p>The windows were open, and so were the doors, but
this only gave a partial relief.</p>

<p>"What on earth is the matter with the chimney?" asked
Mr. Floyd.</p>

<p>"I stopped it, sir," replied Tommy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"Put the doormat on the top of it."</p>

<p>"You did, did you? Wait till I catch you!" cried Mr.
Floyd. "I'll teach you to play your jokes upon me."</p>

<p>Tommy endeavored to escape, but Mr. Floyd caught
him by the ear.</p>

<p>"I've got him," he exclaimed, "now pound him. Thrash
him. Punch him. Punch him severely. This will never
do. He's worse than Bobsey, and that is saying a great
deal."</p>

<p>The Rev. C. Floyd grasped Tommy by the coat collar
and shook him so violently that four more buttons
dropped off his jacket, which consequently bulged out
in front in a very dilapidated and drunken manner, suggestive
of having been on a spree, and not having had
time to put in the necessary repairs.</p>

<p>"Leave off!" cried Tommy.</p>

<p>"Are you a fool?" said Mr. Floyd.</p>

<p>"I don't know, but it's my opinion you're trying to
make me one. Let up—now stop! I want you to stop,
or I'll kick your shins. Quit, won't you?"</p>

<p>Mr. Floyd let him go and glared at him.</p>

<p>"Go and take the mat away, and if you play me any
more tricks I'll cane you in the presence of the young
gentlemen," he exclaimed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span></p>

<p>Tommy saw that he had made a mistake and hastened
to rectify it by removing the mat, which being done, the
smoke ascended smoothly, though the wind forced an occasional
puff the wrong way.</p>

<p>The wrath of Mr. Floyd became mollified, and when
Tommy returned he talked to him calmly, and as became
a minister and a schoolmaster.</p>

<p>Bobsey, however, was not satisfied with the result of
the evening's entertainment.</p>

<p>He caught up the kitchen cat, a fine tabby, which was
snoring peacefully on the hearth.</p>

<p>"My gracious!" asked the cook, "what are you going
to do?"</p>

<p>"The guvnor's too mean to have his chimney swept,
and I'm going to do it for him."</p>

<p>"With what?"</p>

<p>"With my new patent," answered Bobsey, grinning.
"I shall drop this cat down the flue and pelt her with
tiles to make her hurry down. She'll come out in the
parlor looking splendid, and the fire won't do more than
singe her fur."</p>

<p>"Oh, you cruel wretch! I'll tell on you."</p>

<p>"You will, eh?" said Bobsey, gravely. "If you do anything
so rash I'll come to your bedside in the night and
cut all your hair off so short you'll have to wear a wig."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span></p>

<p>"A wig!" repeated Susan, horrified at the mere thought
of such a terror.</p>

<p>"You stop here, Susan, and don't never 'oller about
me," said Bobsey, imperiously.</p>

<p>Calling the cat such pet names as "poor tabby" and
"good old Tom," he conveyed it to the roof.</p>

<p>He was as good as his word.</p>

<p>The cat was thrown down the chimney, and in spite of
its claws, forced to descend.</p>

<p>Tremendous quantities of soot were dislodged in the
foul chimney by its struggles, and shot down with great
velocity.</p>

<p>Never was a chimney more artistically or more cleanly
swept.</p>

<p>The Rev. C. Floyd was indulging in a little lecture,
which he thought would do Tommy good.</p>

<p>"This, my friend," he was saying, "is the land of freedom
and intelligence. You must not allow yourself to
get behind the age. Keep pace with the times. There
are people who would stifle education—who would throw
a dense pall of black ignorance over the country,
and——"</p>

<p>At this moment a terrific avalanche of soot fell down,
covering those in front of the fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>It flew all over the room, settling on the table, books
and carpet nearly an inch thick.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Floyd and Tommy, as soon as they could
get their eyes open, looked at one another in blank dismay.</p>

<p>They were as black as negroes, and began to sneeze
and cough as if they had suddenly caught cold.</p>

<p>"Dear me," said Mr. Floyd, retreating to the door.</p>

<p>"What in the world is it?" exclaimed Mrs. Floyd, following
him.</p>

<p>Down came another cloud of soot, which struck Tommy
full in the face.</p>

<p>Mr. Floyd opened the door and called for help.</p>

<p>Suddenly a dark object darted down the chimney, surrounded
with soot, and uttering a fiendish scream as its
feet touched the coals, dashed across the room, made one
spring for the window, leaped into the street and was
seen no more.</p>

<p>"The devil!" muttered Mr. Floyd.</p>

<p>"Heaven defend us!" said his wife.</p>

<p>The young gentlemen came out of the schoolroom, and
seeing these black, unearthly looking objects before them,
hastily retreated.</p>

<p>Mr. Floyd looked toward the staircase.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>

<p>He saw Bobsey coming down, and a suspicion at once
crowded his mind.</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Nowhere," replied Bobsey.</p>

<p>"What was it you put down the chimney?"</p>

<p>"Vell, then, 'ere's a go?" said Bobsey, assuming an
air of injured innocence. "'Cos I'm going to leave your
hemploy, I'm not to be accused of everything. Oh! no—not
much. I ain't a nigger slave."</p>

<p>"I'll send for a policeman," cried Mr. Floyd.</p>

<p>"Send for a dozen," said Bobsey, who retreated to the
kitchen.</p>

<p>Mr. Floyd's anger was now at its height.</p>

<p>He seized Tommy and dragged him into the schoolroom.</p>

<p>"You're in the plot," he exclaimed, "and I'll cane you.
Bend your back, sir, and touch your toes with your fingers."
At the same time he took a cane from his desk.</p>

<p>"I won't," answered Tommy, resolutely.</p>

<p>The Rev. C. Floyd looked perfectly diabolical with his
black face and hands, while Tommy resembled one of
the attendant imps.</p>

<p>All the young gentlemen were highly amused, but the
discipline of the academy was so strict that they did
not dare to laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span></p>

<p>Finding that Tommy would not submit to the cane, the
reverend gentleman endeavored to strike him where he
stood.</p>

<p>The boy, however, dived between his legs, throwing
him on his face, and ran away to the kitchen, where the
cook considerately washed his face and hands, and sewed
the buttons on his coat.</p>

<p>"Now," exclaimed Bobsey, "you look less like a Heast
Hindian, and more of a Christian. Warn't it a lark?
Oh! crickey, didn't I split with laughing ven I saw old
Floyd near smothered with soot!"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid he'll be down on me for it," said Tommy.</p>

<p>"Never mind, you and me's friends, and if you get the
dirty kick out, I'll see hafter you."</p>

<p>"Will you, indeed?"</p>

<p>"Vill I? I promise that you shan't want as long as
I've got a shilling to whack up, if it's only to spite the
old man," replied Bobsey.</p>

<p>All at once Mrs. Floyd's voice was heard calling:</p>

<p>"Fire! Fire!"</p>

<p>"Bless us and save us!" cried the cook.</p>

<p>"Vot's up now?" said Bobsey.</p>

<p>He ran upstairs to examine, and came back with the
intelligence that the parlor was on fire.</p>

<p>"I think," he remarked, "that the cat coming from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
fire must have caught a live coal and dropped it in the
window curtain, for the front of the room's a-blazin' away
like mad."</p>

<p>"Won't you help put it out?" said Tommy.</p>

<p>"Not I. Vy should I? The engine'll be here as soon
as the peeler on the beat sees the flames, and I'm goin'
out into the street to see the fun. Come on, Yankee."</p>

<p>"All right, Johnny Bull," replied Tommy.</p>

<p>The house was now all excitement. The young gentlemen
ran about with water jugs, making feeble efforts
to put out the fire.</p>

<p>Mrs. Floyd fainted and was carried out in the snow,
while her husband, with a small garden syringe, squirted
at the flames, which were increasing in fury and intensity
every moment.</p>

<p>Wild Charley was the only one who had any sense.</p>

<p>He put on his hat and ran to the engine house, which
was fortunately in the next street, and gave the alarm.</p>

<p>Bobsey, with Tommy by his side, formed one of a rapidly
increasing crowd that lined the pavement opposite.</p>

<p>He enjoyed the fire as only boys can, and when the
flames darted out of the parlor windows, took off his
cap, waved it, and cried:</p>

<p>"Hooray!"</p>

<p>Tommy was much concerned at the state of affairs, for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
he saw a prospect of losing the new home that he had
so recently acquired.</p>

<p>By and by the engine came snorting and panting up
to the scene of the fire. People all up and down the street
were aroused.</p>

<p>The firemen got at the hydrant and fastened the hose,
and soon two streams of water were playing on the
flames.</p>

<p>"Go it, boys! pump on her!" exclaimed Bobsey, wild
with excitement. "Let her have it. 'Ere's a jolly spree!"</p>

<p>The water descended in streams on the flames, but for
some time did not appear to take any effect.</p>

<p>All this time the feathery snow descended pitilessly.</p>

<p class="center">TOMMY FINDS A FRIEND IN BOBSEY.</p>


<p>In spite of the efforts of the firemen, the flames, aided
by a strong northerly wind which had suddenly sprung
up, increased in volume and intensity.</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. Floyd began to recognize the fact that
his house would eventually succumb to the flames, and he
remembered that he had a box containing money and
valuable papers in the room in which he slept.</p>

<p>Calling his son, he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Charles, I am ruined if I cannot save my private box.
What am I to do?"</p>

<p>Wild Charley surveyed the situation, and concluded
that, though hazardous in the extreme, an attempt might
be made to enter the burning house.</p>

<p>"Where is the box?" was Charley's only question.</p>

<p>"Under the bed in my room. But, for Heaven's sake,
do not be rash."</p>

<p>Wild Charley said nothing more. He ran past the firemen
and gained the front door, regardless of cries to stop
which arose from many throats.</p>

<p>The staircase was on fire, but he dashed through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
flames, which licked his body as if they had him in deathly
embrace, and was soon lost to sight.</p>

<p>Suddenly a tremendous shout arose. Standing on the
roof of the house was perceived the figure of Charley,
who held a box under his arm. So far his desperate enterprise
had been successful, but he knew not how to regain
the street, as the burning of the staircase had cut
off all retreat.</p>

<p>The firemen now raised their ladder-like apparatus
against the side of the flaming house, and Charley commenced
his descent, but when about halfway down, the
crowd saw him disappear.</p>

<p>The roof had given way.</p>

<p>Wild Charley was precipitated into the midst of the
flames, and everyone was convinced that he was beyond
help now.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Floyd and the young gentlemen were
taken into the house of a sympathizing neighbor, where
the grief of the schoolmaster and his wife had full vent
in private. Their sorrow for the loss of their son was
overwhelming.</p>

<p>Nobody bestowed any attention upon Tommy and
Bobsey, who watched the efforts of the firemen until they
had conquered the flames.</p>

<p>When the gray dawn of morning broke upon the snow-clad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
scene, the engines were playing upon a smoking,
smoldering mass of charred and blackened fragments,
under which lay the burned body of Wild Charley.</p>

<p>"What'll we do now?" asked Tommy.</p>

<p>"I told you," replied Bobsey, "as 'ow I'd got another
place at Dr. Slasher's, and he'll 'ave to take you, too."</p>

<p>"I guess he won't want two boys; but I'll come for
nothing, only my board."</p>

<p>"He's standing at his door now," said Bobsey. "I'll
go and speak to 'im about you."</p>

<p>Tommy waited impatiently while his friend went to
make an application on his behalf to Dr. Slasher.</p>

<p>The doctor was quite a character in his way. Being
moderately well off, he was not dependent on his practice
for a living. He had served in the war and lost a
leg, which he had replaced by a cork one, with a stick at
the end of it instead of a boot.</p>

<p>He was hot-tempered and impulsive, and fond of using
the expression, "Never in the wide, wide world," if he
had made up his mind not to do a particular thing.</p>

<p>When Bobsey approached him he was smoking a cigar.</p>

<p>"This 'as been somethin' of a fire, sir," exclaimed
Bobsey, "and I'm burnt hout. Will you take me in as
you promised?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied Dr. Slasher. "When I make a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
promise I keep it. You shall be my errand boy—take
out the medicines and make yourself generally useful."</p>

<p>"Thank you doctor," said Bobsey, "I'm much
hobliged, and shall be still more so if you'll help a frien'
of mine."</p>

<p>"Who is he?"</p>

<p>"Stranger in this country. Was engaged by Mr. Floyd,
but now he's hout of work 'cos of the fire. He'll 'ave to
starve, and you wouldn't like to see him do that."</p>

<p>"Never in the wide," answered the good-natured doctor.
"He shall attend to my surgery. I'll teach him to
mix potions and roll pills."</p>

<p>"That's hall he wants," said Bobsey. "Can we go and
pitch hour tents in the kitchen till morning, sir?"</p>

<p>"Go right in," said Dr. Slasher. "I'm about to go to
bed myself. It's no use waiting up any longer. This is
the most disappointing fire I ever witnessed. My professional
skill has not once been called into requisition."</p>

<p>"Wild Charley's burnt hup, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, the young scamp deserved it, and I guess they
won't put him to sweeping snow where he's gone to.
Now you and your friend can sleep by the stove in the
kitchen, but I shall want you up in the morning. You'll
have to work, or I'll know the reason why."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>

<p>Bobsey promised acquiescence, and ran away, to make
Tommy acquainted with the welcome news.</p>

<p>"Hi've got you hon," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"How can I thank you?" replied Tommy. "This will
save me from an awful lot of misery. It's dreadful to be
in a foreign country without money or friends."</p>

<p>The doctor had retired, leaving the door open for them,
and the two boys entered the house, making themselves
comfortable in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Next day they were given a room to themselves, and
their duties were mapped out for them.</p>

<p>Dr. Slasher was not a married man, and his home was
kept by an elderly lady who might in years gone by have
been called good-looking, but who had long, long ago
lost all pretensions to beauty. Her name was Miss Minks,
and she was cook and housekeeper all in one.</p>

<p>For some days all went on smoothly at the doctor's.</p>

<p>It was quite a week before Tommy was allowed an opportunity
for exercising his remarkable powers for doing
things as they ought not to be done.</p>

<p>Dr. Slasher had been invited to dine at a neighbor's
house, but having a patient to attend he could not go.</p>

<p>Walking into the surgery where Tommy was rolling
pills, he said:</p>

<p>"Go to Mrs. Jones at 99 in this street, and say with my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
compliments that I can't dine with her to-day, though
there is nothing I should like better, as I don't expect
I shall get much to eat at home."</p>

<p>As Tommy walked up the street he conceived a great
idea. His master could not go out to dinner, but evidently
wanted something to eat. It should be his business
to see that this was attended to.</p>

<p>When he arrived at Mrs. Jones', he asked to see that
lady, and was ushered into the hall, where she came in
full-dress.</p>

<p>"Doc's compliments, ma'am!" he exclaimed, "and he
can't come to dine, but he'd like something to eat, so if
you'll put the grub in a basket, I'll take it home for him."</p>

<p>"Oh, eh! yes," replied Mrs. Jones, in some confusion.
"Wait here and I'll attend to it."</p>

<p>She knew that Dr. Slasher was an eccentric character,
and thought that he might have sent for something to
eat, though it was an extraordinary thing for a gentleman
to do; so she had the cook put up a basketful of good
things with which Tommy returned to the house in triumph.</p>

<p>The doctor was just going out, and had his hat and
coat on.</p>

<p>"Did you give my message to Mrs. Jones?" he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir, and as you couldn't go yourself, I got her
to give me your dinner in a basket."</p>

<p>"You did what!" thundered the doctor.</p>

<p>"Got your dinner, sir; here it is," replied Tommy,
opening the lid of the basket and displaying the contents.</p>

<p>"Are you a fool, or what are you?" vociferated the
doctor.</p>

<p>"I don't know," responded Tommy, sulkily. "It seems
as if I never can do anything right."</p>

<p>"Now, my boy," said the doctor, "you'll take this half-crown,
and you'll go to a florist's to buy a bouquet of
flowers. Having purchased the article, you will take it
to Mrs. Jones, with my compliments, and explain that the
dinner was your mistake."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"If you make any blunder about it this time. I'll put
leeches on you to suck your blood."</p>

<p>Tommy had to walk some distance to reach a florist's,
and when he did, he found the man had only one bouquet
left.</p>

<p>"How much for this?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Two and-six," replied the man; and Tommy, throwing
down the half-crown, took up the bouquet, which was
very pretty and tastefully arranged.</p>

<p>Going at once to Mrs. Jones', he was fortunate enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
to find that the lady had just quitted the dinner table, and
she saw him in the hall.</p>

<p>"How did Dr. Slasher like what I sent him?" she asked,
with a smile.</p>

<p>"First-class, ma'am," replied Tommy, "only it was a
mistake of mine, and I've brought you a bokay from the
doctor."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I feel very much obliged to the doctor, and
you are a very good boy," she exclaimed, much gratified
at the present. "Here's a shilling for you."</p>

<p>This was intended as a gratuity for Tommy, but he
thought she wanted to pay for the flowers, and that it was
his duty to take the money back to his employer.</p>

<p>"Please, ma'am, that ain't enough," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"It cost two-and-six. I want a shilling and sixpence
more."</p>

</div>

<p class="center">A DOSE FOR THE DOCTOR.</p>


<p>A look of displeasure crossed Mrs. Jones' face, but she
handed Tommy the money.</p>

<p>"Get out of the house," she said, "and tell Dr. Slasher
that I don't understand this conduct at all. He's no gentleman."</p>

<p>"I'll tell him, ma'am," answered Tommy, who was getting
bewildered again, and away he posted home.</p>

<p>"Did you make that all right?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You can bet I did," answered Tommy, with a triumphant
smile. "I'm the hunky-dory boy who can fix
things."</p>

<p>"Well, what did she say?"</p>

<p>"She handed me a shilling for the flowers, which cost
two-and-six, but I wasn't going to be beat that way."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"She couldn't play that on me, sir, and I made her dub
up the other eighteen pence, and she told me to get out
of the house, and let you know that you were no gentleman.
You see, she was mad because I tumbled to her
little game."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span></p>

<p>The doctor's eyes flashed fire, and his cork leg seemed
to quiver with indignation.</p>

<p>"You rascal!" he exclaimed. "Do you want to ruin
me? Have you no knowledge of the usages of good society?
Does a gentleman ever expect a lady to pay for
the presents he makes her?"</p>

<p>"I did my best, sir."</p>

<p>"Did your worst, you mean. Sit in that chair while I
get the leeches."</p>

<p>Tommy sank into the chair, and Dr. Slasher tied a piece
of rope round him, which rendered it impossible for him
to move.</p>

<p>In a glass vase were kept the leeches, a couple of which
the doctor took out, putting one on each of the boy's
cheeks.</p>

<p>Their clammy feel caused a thrill of horror to run
through his frame, which increased when he felt a puncture
of the skin.</p>

<p>The leeches were at their work, and drinking his blood.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, take them off!" he screamed. "They'll kill
me! They'll drain me dry, and I shall go about like a
walking skeleton."</p>

<p>"They like boys' blood," the doctor remarked. "It
seems to agree with them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span></p>

<p>"Oh, sir, please, sir, take the beastly things away,"
pleaded Tommy.</p>

<p>The doctor was determined, and Tommy's pleadings
did not move him in the least, so the leeches continued
to suck until they were thoroughly gorged, when they
dropped off and were carefully replaced in their vases.</p>

<p>"Now," said the doctor, "I shall expect you to be a
smarter boy after this, for I have been at considerable
pains to extract the bad blood from you."</p>

<p>Tommy was untied, and rubbing his cheeks, ran downstairs
to find Bobsey, and get him to condole with him.</p>

<p>He found Bobsey sitting by the stove, all by himself.
There was no other servant, as Miss Minks did all the
work.</p>

<p>"What's up?" inquired Bobsey.</p>

<p>Tommy related what had happened.</p>

<p>"Oh, my heyes!" said Bobsey, "ain't that a shame! I
never 'eard of such a rig as that."</p>

<p>"I'll be revenged."</p>

<p>"What'll yer do?"</p>

<p>"There's a big auger in the cellar, and I'll bore holes
in the surgery floor, so that old Slasher will stick his
leg in one. I'll have a big stone in the room underneath,
and I'll fasten the stone to his leg so he can't move.
That'll be bully."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span></p>

<p>"First-rate," replied Bobsey.</p>

<p>"Then," continued Tommy, warming with his subject,
"I'll get a lancet and stab him all over. I'll physic him
with a dose of salts and——"</p>

<p>"'Old on," interrupted Bobsey. "S'pose he takes and
sacks you?"</p>

<p>"I won't let him loose till he promises to forgive me."</p>

<p>"You'll do, young one," Bobsey said. "I don't want
to offend you."</p>

<p>Tommy was as good as his word, for he worked hard
that night with the auger, and made at least a dozen holes
in various parts of the surgery floor.</p>

<p>The next day Dr. Slasher had occasion to find fault
with Tommy, who was not making the pills the proper
shape.</p>

<p>"You've got the mold," said the doctor, "why don't you
turn them out properly?"</p>

<p>"If you don't like my way, do it yourself," replied
Tommy.</p>

<p>"What!" cried the doctor; "getting impudent, are
you? I'll have to give you a dose of salts and senna,
young man."</p>

<p>"If you catch me."</p>

<p>"That won't give me much trouble," replied Dr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
Slasher, who proceeded to fill a glass with a nauseous-looking
fluid.</p>

<p>When the dose was ready he called to Tommy to come
and drink it.</p>

<p>"Not much," said Tommy.</p>

<p>"I order you to take it, and if you don't, I'll make you."</p>

<p>"You've got to spell able," was Tommy's reply, as he
moved toward the door.</p>

<p>The doctor tried to intercept him, but as the boy had
reckoned, he stuck his wooden leg into one of the holes,
and was held fast.</p>

<p>Putting his finger to his nose, in token of derision,
Tommy ran below and securely fastened the large stone
to the end of the wooden leg.</p>

<p>"Now I've got him hard and fast," said Tommy to
himself.</p>

<p>In vain the doctor tried to extricate himself; he was, as
it were, rooted to the spot.</p>

<p>Returning to the room, Tommy seized the glass containing
the salts and senna.</p>

<p>"Drink this," he ordered.</p>

<p>"I won't. Am I to be dictated to by a boy?" replied
the doctor. "What on earth is the matter with my leg?"</p>

<p>"I've made it fast below. It's anchored."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span></p>

<p>"You scoundrel! I'll have you arrested. I'll give you
six months. Go and undo my leg."</p>

<p>"Not yet. You've got to take your medicine. Your
blood wants cooling off. I'll give you some leeches presently."</p>

<p>Tommy held the medicine to the doctor's lips, and
forced him to drink the contents, which very soon had
a griping effect.</p>

<p>"Oh!" he cried, putting his hands to his vest, "this is
awful!"</p>

<p>"Will you ever put leeches on me again?" said Tommy.</p>

<p>"Never in the wide world. Let me go, there's a good
boy. I'll make you a handsome present. I will indeed."</p>

<p>"Do you forgive me, and promise never to say a word
about this?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes."</p>

<p>"Then I'll undo the stone, but jest mind how you attack
a poor boy another time. I'm my own best friend,
if I am alone in a strange country."</p>

<p>"I'll be a father to you, Tommy."</p>

<p>"Yes, you will, over the left; but I'll let up on you this
time, boss," said Tommy, who went downstairs and untied
the stone.</p>

<p>Aided by Bobsey, he pulled the doctor out of the unpleasant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
predicament in which he was placed, and set
him down on a chair.</p>

<p>After a while the doctor said:</p>

<p>"Here's sixpence for you both. Run up to Mr. Garretson's
with this medicine, and let me know how he is."</p>

<p>On arriving at Mr. Garretson's house, they were informed
that the gentleman in question was dead.</p>

<p>"Could we see him, miss?" inquired Bobsey.</p>

<p>"The corpse is in that room on the left," replied the
girl, pointing to a door. "You can go in, but I can't stay,
as I've got my work to do downstairs."</p>

<p>The two boys entered the room where the dead body
of Mr. Garretson was lying. He was a little man, about
seventy, and had died of some internal complaint, which
had defied the skill of his physician.</p>

<p>"The guv'ner would like to have that specimen," said
Tommy.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Bobsey. "I heard him say he'd give
something for the body, to make a hexamination of it,
but he didn't think as how the family would stand it."</p>

<p>"Let's wrap it up in a blanket, and take it down the
road."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"So that the old man may have a show at it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>"Hi'm hagreeable," answered Bobsey, "only there'll be
a jolly row about it, I hexpect."</p>

<p>The idea was no sooner conceived than executed.</p>

<p>Rolling a blanket round the body, the boys carried it
out of the house without being perceived, and proceeded
to the doctor's with their remarkable burden.</p>

<p>They had not been gone long when the only son of Mr.
Garretson, who had been telegraphed for, arrived in a
cab.</p>

<p>Sally opened the door, and recognizing him, at once
said:</p>

<p>"He's gone at last, sir."</p>

<p>"So mother says in the dispatch. Where is mother
now?"</p>

<p>"She's feeling bad, upstairs, sir."</p>

<p>"Then I won't disturb her at present. I'll take a look
at it."</p>

<p>By "it" the son meant the corpse.</p>

<p>"It's in here, sir," said Sally, opening the door of the
room, which the boys had so lately robbed of its contents.</p>

<p>"I don't see anything," remarked the son.</p>

<p>"Well, I never did! It was there just now!" cried
Sally, in alarm.</p>

<p>Young Garretson looked sternly at her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span></p>

<p>"There is something wrong about this!" he exclaimed;
"explain it."</p>

<p>Sally began to cry, and put the corner of her apron to
her eyes.</p>

<p>"Wretched girl!" he continued, shaking her arm,
"what have you done with my father's body?"</p>

<p>"I ain't done nothing; but"—her face brightened—"it
might have been those two young varmints."</p>

<p>"What two young varmints?"</p>

<p>"Them as come from the doctor."</p>

<p>"Dr. Slasher's boys?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Have they been here?"</p>

<p>"A few minutes ago. I let them in to see the deceased,
and I'll swear the corpse was all right then."</p>

<p>"Ha!" exclaimed the young man, "I see it all. This
is an infamous plot on the part of the doctor to obtain
the body of my esteemed and venerable parent for the
purpose of dissection, but I'll frustrate it. Rouse the
neighbors!"</p>

<p>Young Garretson himself ran into the street, and was
fortunate enough to meet with a policeman, to whom he
related his suspicions.</p>

<p>A crowd soon collected, and the news that the doctor
had been stealing a body spread with great rapidity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span></p>

<p>Tommy and Bobsey managed to reach the house without
molestation, entered by the surgery door, and saw Dr.
Slasher looking over the pages of a medical book.</p>

<p>"Well," said the doctor, "how is Mr. Garretson?"</p>

<p>"He's come to answer for himself," replied Tommy.</p>

<p>"Indeed! I wasn't aware that he would ever again be
able to leave his bed," said the doctor, in astonishment.</p>

<p>"'Ere he is!" cried Bobsey, undoing the blanket.</p>

<p>"Why, what in the wide world is this?" asked the doctor,
viewing the ghastly corpse.</p>

<p>"We thought you wanted it, sir, and brought it along
without anyone seeing it," said Tommy.</p>

<p>"Dear me! This is a very complicated case, and I
should like to anatomize it extremely, but the people are
so prejudiced—I may say ignorant—that I am almost
afraid you have done wrong."</p>

<p>"We can take it back when you're through with it, sir."</p>

<p>"I have a good mind to risk it."</p>

<p>Dr. Slasher eyed the corpse with an affectionate air.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a noise in the street.</p>

<p>"What is all that?" he said, going to the window and
looking out.</p>

<p>The uproar increased, and loud cries were raised, the
doctor's name being easily distinguishable amid groans
and hisses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>"They have found it out. The neighborhood is roused.
The street is alive with people. I'm ruined!" exclaimed
the doctor.</p>

<p>Bobsey and Tommy looked blankly at one another.
No one spoke.</p>

<p>If the doctor was caught with the evidence of his guilt
on the table before him, the people would believe him to
be a body snatcher, and perhaps handle him roughly.</p>

<p>Tommy had made one of his charming blunders again.
But an idea struck him.</p>

<p>"I'd know what I'd do, sir," he said.</p>

<p>"What?" eagerly demanded the doctor.</p>

<p>"I'd put the body in Miss Minks' bed."</p>

<p>"Happy thought; she's downstairs, and will suspect
nothing. We'll do it," said the doctor.</p>

<p>"Good hagain! Brayvo for hour side! Who says we
can't do it?" cried Bobsey.</p>

<p>"Hurry!" said the doctor. "They'll never think of
looking in her bed for it, and at nighttime, when all is
still, we'll get the body back to its own house."</p>

<p>Miss Minks slept on the floor where the surgery was,
and all the boys had to do was to carry the body across
the hall, from one room to the other.</p>

<p>They deposited it in the bed of the maiden lady, and
covered it up carefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>"All right?" asked the doctor, as they returned.</p>

<p>"Fixed it all up A 1," replied Tommy.</p>

<p>A heavy ringing was now heard at the surgery bell, and
Miss Minks, proceeding from the lower regions, answered
it.</p>

<p>Mr. Garretson, accompanied by the policeman and followed
by an indignant crowd, appeared on the steps.</p>

<p>"What is your pleasure, gentlemen?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Where's Dr. Slasher?" asked the young man.</p>

<p>"In his surgery, where he will be pleased to see you,
if you will step in," she replied.</p>

<p>"I will do so," returned Mr. Garretson.</p>

<p>The policeman kept back the surging crowd, and the
young man in search of a father entered the doctor's
surgery, where he was apparently calmly reading, the
boys being engaged in compounding various medicines,
and working away as if their lives depended upon their
exertions.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">A HASTY TRIP.</p>


<p>We must now bestow some attention upon Mr. Smithers
and his family, whom we have left in the background
since Tommy took his trip to Liverpool.</p>

<p>When Charley Barker stepped down the gangway, in
obedience to the summons of the bell which ordered all
on shore, he did not doubt that Tommy was following
him.</p>

<p>But when the communication between the steamer
and the dock was shut off he began to look curiously
around him, for nothing whatever was to be seen of his
friend.</p>

<p>The ship slowly left her dock, and Charley Barker became
aware of the fact that, for some reason altogether
unknown to him, Tommy had not left with the other
friends of the passengers.</p>

<p>Satisfied with this conviction, he returned quickly to
his father's, and having reported the safe bestowal of the
coffin, hurried to Mr. Smithers' house and communicated
the facts of the case.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span></p>

<p>"Silly boy!" cried Mrs. Smithers. "He is always doing
something stupid."</p>

<p>"Well, ma'am, all the boys say he's a little soft."</p>

<p>"I am in hopes he will grow out of that," said his
mother. "But tell me, Charley, do you think he'll come
to any harm?"</p>

<p>"I guess not, ma'am. They'll make him work, that's
all, and the American consul at Liverpool is bound to
send him back."</p>

<p>Charley Barker now retired, and the unhappy mother
tried to comfort herself with the reflection that the boy
was on board an English ship, bound to a well-known
port, and among officers who would be kind to the poor
waif whom an accident had cast among them.</p>

<p>But her troubles were not over for that day.</p>

<p>To her surprise, a few minutes after Charley Barker
had taken his departure, Mr. Smithers entered the room,
which was a very unusual occurrence for him, as he usually
did not make his appearance until business at the
store was over.</p>

<p>Throwing himself into a chair, he glanced at his wife,
and remarked that there were traces of silent tears in her
eyes and on her cheeks.</p>

<p>"Crying again!" he exclaimed, petulantly. "I never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
saw such a woman. You're always sniveling at something
or another."</p>

<p>"Tommy's gone," she replied, bursting out weeping
again.</p>

<p>"A good job, too. Where's he flitted to?"</p>

<p>"He went on board an ocean steamer with Charley
Barker, and through his carelessness or stupidity, did not
go ashore with the others, and was carried along."</p>

<p>"That boy's little better than a born idiot!" exclaimed
Mr. Smithers, unfeelingly.</p>

<p>"I'm sure he isn't that," replied the mother, checking
her tears.</p>

<p>"I tell you he's the fool of the family, and I'm glad to
be rid of him. He'll fall on his legs—all these half-witted
ones do—so dismiss that from your mind, while I tell you
a bit of real trouble."</p>

<p>She looked at him strangely. There was that in his
bloodshot eyes, his haggard appearance and somewhat
disordered dress which induced her to think that something
very unusual had happened. Nor was she mistaken.</p>

<p>"Maria," he said, "I'm ruined; don't start or go into
hysterics, because there is no time for that. I didn't come
home in the middle of the day to lay off. I'm here to
arrange for our immediate flight."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span></p>

<p>"Flight!" she stammered. "Where? how? what do you
mean? What have you done?"</p>

<p>"Embezzled my employer's money!"</p>

<p>This reply completely took Mrs. Smithers' breath away,
for the communication was totally unexpected. In the
shock which this announcement caused her Tommy's disappearance
was quite forgotten.</p>

<p>"Maria," continued the wretched man, "I scarcely know
how to act. You must help me in this crisis."</p>

<p>"Have you been discovered?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I know not. This morning one of the partners asked
me for my books, which he wished to put into an accountant's
hands. His suspicions are aroused. My salary
was only two thousand dollars a year and I have been
spending double. Even now the detectives may be after
me."</p>

<p>"It is horrible!" said his wife, covering her face with
her hands.</p>

<p>"There is no safety unless we flee," continued Smithers.
"I have collected a debt due the firm, on my way
home, to have money enough to go to the West. Let us
pack up what is really necessary for ourselves and the
children. To-night at five there is an express train to
Omaha. Will you go?"</p>

<p>"I will," answered Mrs. Smithers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p>"That is settled!" he exclaimed, with a sigh of relief,
and kissing her affectionately, he added:</p>

<p>"You are ever good to me, Maria."</p>

<p>"I am only returning the love you have always shown
me," she rejoined.</p>

<p>"Get everything in readiness," he continued, "and I
will be here with a coach as the shades of night are falling.
Heaven grant I may not be too late."</p>

<p>Mrs. Smithers watched him depart, and then went
about her work like one in a dream, ransacking drawers
and hastily packing up those things that she deemed
would be of the greatest use to them. While she was thus
occupied the children came in, and regarded her with
astonishment.</p>

<p>"Mamma!" exclaimed Alice, "what are you doing?"</p>

<p>"My dear children," answered Mrs. Smithers, "circumstances
have occurred which render it necessary for your
father to leave Jersey City at once."</p>

<p>"Leave!" said Harold. "Where are we going to?"</p>

<p>"West. That is all I can tell you at present. Let it
be sufficient for you that a great calamity has befallen us."</p>

<p>She did not explain matters, as she wished to conceal
her husband's shame from his children.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," said Harold, rudely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>"Nor I," replied Alice, in the habitual tone of disrespect
which she adopted when speaking to her mother.</p>

<p>"It's some dodge," continued Harold. "Charley Barker
has just told us about Tommy's going over to Europe,
and I guess you want to steal all you can and follow
him."</p>

<p>"Harold! Alice!" she said. "I would have spared you
the pain of what I am going to tell you. It's only your
wicked and undutiful conduct that forces it from me."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" replied Harold, satirically, "you care a
great deal for us, we know that."</p>

<p>"A nice life we should have if it hadn't been for papa,"
chimed in Alice.</p>

<p>"Will you listen to me?" pleaded Mrs. Smithers, who,
unaccustomed to exact obedience from the wayward children,
did not know how to appease their spite and anger.</p>

<p>"Go on, we're listening," answered Harold.</p>

<p>"Your papa has been stealing the money from his employers.
They have asked for his books, which are being
examined by an accountant, and we do not know from one
hour to another when the police will be here."</p>

<p>The children looked blankly at one another.</p>

<p>This was a revelation which they had been far from
expecting, as their belief in their father's high standing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
and honor was so great that it would have survived anything
but such a rude shock as this.</p>

<p>"In about an hour's time," Mrs. Smithers went on,
"your father will be here with a coach, and we start for
Omaha. Where we shall go from there I can't tell, but
if you are wise you will help me to pack and make the
best of this misfortune instead of grumbling any more."</p>

<p>Harold and Alice now hung down their heads for
shame, and did not utter another remark to their mother,
though they conversed together in a low tone.</p>

<p>At five o'clock everything was ready, and when the
coach drove up the trunks were put outside and the family
occupied the interior.</p>

<p>They proceeded to the railway depot, all being silent
and anxious.</p>

<p>Smithers had been obliged to sacrifice his furniture for
a small sum to a neighbor whom he could trust, and with
all his worldly wealth in his pocket, amounting to about
a thousand dollars, he started for that part of the American
Continent known as the West.</p>

<p>Omaha was reached without any interference on the
part of the telegraph, which seemed to indicate that if
his employers had actually discovered his guilt, they
either did not intend to prosecute him or could not discover
where he had gone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span></p>

<p>Three days were spent in Omaha, during which time
Smithers made up his mind, according to information he
had received, to locate in Silver City, a rising mining
town in Nevada.</p>

<p>The distance between Silver City and the nearest railroad
station was fifty miles or thereabouts.</p>

<p>When about halfway toward Silver City they met a
man on horseback, riding at speed. He had lost his hat,
and appeared to be in the utmost haste to leave some person
or persons behind.</p>

<p>Seeing the approaching wagon, he drew rein, and
Smithers stopped to talk to him, hoping to gain some
information as to the state of the road and general condition
of the country.</p>

<p>It had been hinted to him in more than one quarter
that a band of lawless depredators occupied a valley or
pass in the hills known as Dead Snake Canyon.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
</div>

<p class="center">OUT WEST.</p>


<p>As the stranger approached Smithers had an opportunity
of observing that he was about the middle age,
bronzed by exposure to the weather, and attired as befitted
a raiser of stock or a farmer.</p>

<p>"Good-day," exclaimed Smithers. "What's the good
word?"</p>

<p>"Good-day to you, stranger," answered the horseman.
"I've nothing that I'd like to tell you, but whether it
scares you or not, I reckon it's my duty to put you on
your guard."</p>

<p>"Against what?"</p>

<p>"A thieving son of a gun who keeps in Dead Snake
Canyon, which isn't more than three miles ahead of you."</p>

<p>"Is he a robber?"</p>

<p>"You bet he is," was the answer. "Though I didn't
think he'd rob me, as I'm one of the boys myself. There
isn't a man this side of the Rocky Mountains who doesn't
know Joe Brady, the gambler."</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Brady," exclaimed Smithers, "did he try to
stop you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>"All he knew. He and two others must have heard
that I was leaving Silver for Virginia City, and had considerable
money about me, for they rode out from behind
a bluff and commenced shooting free."</p>

<p>"And you escaped?"</p>

<p>"I did. A bullet carried off my hat, but I turned in
the saddle, dropped one man, killed another's horse and
the third turned tail and fled."</p>

<p>"Is it possible?" gasped Smithers.</p>

<p>"Then I made the running at a two-twenty pace, you
bet, for I thought there might be more of them, and I
never drew rein till I saw you in the distance."</p>

<p>Mrs. Smithers regarded her husband blankly, and the
trepidation which this news caused the whole party to
feel was written in their faces, Alice and Harold becoming
particularly pale.</p>

<p>"Can the sheriff and his posse do nothing in the premises?"
inquired Smithers.</p>

<p>"I guess neither the sheriff, nor the selectmen, nor the
vigilance committee care to attend to business which is so
far from them."</p>

<p>"Do they know of it?"</p>

<p>"Indeed they do. This fellow—Capt. Jordan, as he
calls himself—has infested Dead Snake Canyon for a
week or more, and has stopped a dozen travelers; but he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
may stop a dozen more before he gets up the dander of
the Silver citizens. I was told of him, and that's what
made me take the disguise of an honest farmer."</p>

<p>"Perhaps they'll stop us," said Mrs. Smithers.</p>

<p>"That's a dead sure thing," answered Brady.</p>

<p>"Is there no other road, sir, that we could take to avoid
this desperado?" asked Smithers.</p>

<p>"None that I know of."</p>

<p>"What will we do?" said Smithers, with a groan of
despair.</p>

<p>"Put your money in your boots and appeal to the fellow's
generosity to let you go on with your stores.
Maybe he'll be after playing at higher game than robbing
a poor emigrant."</p>

<p>"Some of those men," remarked Smithers, "are said
to have some generosity."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" answered Joe Brady. "There was a fellow
that practiced in California, who would never rob a
woman."</p>

<p>"Is it any use showing fight?" inquired Smithers, displaying
a new rifle and a brace of pistols.</p>

<p>"If you want your brains blown out on the prairie. No,
no," answered Brady. "Don't anger them. You're not
strong enough. Who knows how many there may be in
the gang. What can one man do. Think of your wife<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
and children, and if you can't save your property, at least
try to preserve your life for their sake. And now, good-day
and good luck to you," cried Joe Brady.</p>

<p>"The same to you," answered Smithers.</p>

<p>"Remember, I warned you."</p>

<p>"I'm not likely to forget."</p>

<p>The stranger made an inclination of the head to Mr.
Smithers, and putting spurs to his horse, was soon out of
sight.</p>

<p>Smithers put the team in motion again, and the oxen
labored along over the rough, uneven road.</p>

<p>He had traversed two-thirds of the Dead Snake
Canyon without meeting with any human being, and was
congratulating himself upon his escape from Capt.
Jordan.</p>

<p>But his congratulations were premature.</p>

<p>The canyon narrowed toward the extreme end, and
certain cavernous fissures in the rocks on the left-hand
side seemed to indicate a sure and safe hiding place for
marauders.</p>

<p>A huge mass of rock lay directly in the path. It appeared
as if it had been detached from the parent basalt
by some tremendous convulsion of nature.</p>

<p>Finding it necessary to make a slight detour to avoid
the obstacle, Smithers turned the heads of the oxen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span></p>

<p>Scarcely had he turned a dozen yards before two men
on foot stepped out from behind the rock. This had been
their hiding place.</p>

<p>Crape masks covered their faces, and served effectually
to conceal their features.</p>

<p>The foremost, who appeared to be the leader, exclaimed,
in a commanding voice:</p>

<p>"Halt!"</p>

<p>Smithers, who was by no means a brave man, trembled
in every limb.</p>

<p>Both men were armed with pistols, which, as if to increase
the man's terror, they leveled at his head, and with
such an accuracy of aim that he could see by the direction
of the muzzle that he was completely covered.</p>

<p>Mr. Smithers halted the oxen, Mrs. Smithers and the
children crouched down in the wagon and furtively
watched the actions of the robbers.</p>

<p>"Hold up your arms!" commanded the captain.</p>

<p>Smithers did as he was directed, and extended his arms
in the air.</p>

<p>"Where are you from, and what have you got?" was
the next question.</p>

<p>"From Jersey City, and last from Omaha," replied
Smithers. "I have a few stores in the wagon, and very
little money. It is all I have to keep my wife and two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
children. Gentlemen, for pity's sake, don't deprive us of
our only means of gaining a livelihood!"</p>

<p>"Oh, drop on yourself!" answered the captain, impatiently.
"Play light! What are you?—a ranting
preacher?"</p>

<p>"I was a dry-goods clerk, sir."</p>

<p>"What made you quit Jersey City? No lies now!"</p>

<p>"I—I robbed my employers, sir, and had to leave," replied
Smithers, in some confusion.</p>

<p>The other laughed.</p>

<p>"That's a good joke!" he exclaimed. "You steal all
you can lay your hands on, and then object to being
robbed in your turn. Turn and turn about's a square
deal, you know."</p>

<p>He advanced to the wagon.</p>

<p>"Get out of there! Hurry up!" he commanded.</p>

<p>The children hastened to comply with this order, for
the man's appearance was so fierce, and the tone of his
voice so brutal, that they were afraid he would shoot
them without mercy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Smithers was the last to alight.</p>

<p>The captain extended his hand to assist her, but started
back as soon as he beheld her face.</p>

<p>"Je-rusalem!" he muttered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span></p>

<p>She stood before him calmly, and said, in a voice that
trembled with emotion:</p>

<p>"Pray spare us, sir! We are very poor, and——"</p>

<p>"Stop that chinning!" cried the man, in a voice somewhat
gruffer, if possible, than that he had formerly employed,
and which afforded a presumption that he was
striving to disguise it.</p>

<p>She was silent instantly.</p>

<p>"Ben," said the captain, "take this woman away and
place her—you know where. I'll attend to the bloke and
the kids."</p>

<p>Mrs. Smithers shrunk to the side of her husband, as if
to demand that protection which she nevertheless knew
he could not afford to give her.</p>

<p>Smithers, however, ventured to lower one of his arms,
which he put around her waist.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he done so than a bullet whizzed over
his head.</p>

<p>"What did I tell you?" cried the captain. "Up with
that hand!"</p>

<p>He was fain to do as he was told, and the hand was
removed from his wife's waist, to point once more toward
the sky.</p>

<p>Ben, as the captain had called his companion, now
seized Mrs. Smithers by the arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>

<p>She resisted his attention, and uttered scream after
scream; but her strength was unavailing to cope with the
superior force of the ruffian, and she was gradually
dragged from the spot toward one of the cavernous recesses
formed in the rocks to which we have previously
alluded.</p>

<p>When she had finally disappeared from view, the captain
turned his gaze upon Smithers.</p>

<p>"Are these two all your children?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Smithers. "That is, my wife had a child
by a former husband, a sort of vagabond fellow, and——"</p>

<p>"What do you say?" cried the captain, his eyes flashing
angrily through his mask.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, sir, if he is any friend of yours;
but the man pretended to be dead; he turned up, however,
and is now, I am informed, in prison."</p>

<p>"So that woman is not your wife?"</p>

<p>"I account her so, because we all thought this Thompson
dead."</p>

<p>"If her first husband lives, as you state, she belongs to
him, as does the child."</p>

<p>"The child is a soft creature, and he is welcome to him,
if he can find him, though it would be difficult to do so, as
he has gone on a trip to Europe."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span></p>

<p>"Go!" exclaimed the captain; "I shall not touch your
stores or your money, on condition that you say nothing
about being robbed when you reach Silver City."</p>

<p>Smithers was silent.</p>

<p>"What!" cried the robber, angrily; "will you not purchase
your life and your property at so cheap a price?"</p>

<p>"I want my wife, whom you have no right to detain.
Take all I have, and give me her!" exclaimed Smithers.</p>

<p>"By your own admission, all you are entitled to are
these children," said the captain. "Do you comply with
my conditions, or shall I shoot you where you stand?"</p>

<p>"No, no!" exclaimed Smithers, shrinking back from
the uplifted pistol. "Life is sweet! life is precious!"</p>

<p>"Swear!"</p>

<p>"I do!"</p>

<p>"Then get along with your wagon and your brats.
Recollect that if anyone breaks faith with me, I will follow
him to the end of the world and square accounts with
him."</p>

<p>"You shall have no cause."</p>

<p>"Git!" said the captain, in a contemptuous tone.</p>

<p>Harold and Alice once more climbed into the wagon
and Smithers caused the oxen to resume their journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>He was glad to have escaped so easily, but he felt very
mean and contemptible when he thought that he had allowed
his wife to be carried off before his eyes without
raising a finger to help her.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">KILLED BY HIS FATHER.</p>


<p>When Smithers reached Silver City he felt sure that
the people would help him to rescue her, but he was
afraid to make any noise about it.</p>

<p>Not that he had valued the oath he had taken, but he
remembered the robber's threat, and was alarmed lest he
might have been shot, for not keeping faith with him.
What the desperado's motive was for making a prisoner
of Mrs. Smithers he could not imagine. With the resignation
of a self-seeking coward, he made up his mind
that she was lost to him forever. "Papa," said Alice,
"won't you try to get mamma away from that awful,
mean man?"</p>

<p>"I fear, my dear," he replied, "that the attempt would
not only be attended with great danger, but would also
be useless."</p>

<p>"Shall we never see her again?"</p>

<p>"Never," answered the coward, emphatically.</p>

<p>"I don't care much," said Harold; "we can get along
just as well without her as with her."</p>

<p>"But she is our mother," exclaimed Alice, "and I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
very sorry for ever being rude and naughty to her, and
I don't want to lose her. If papa won't try to get her
back again, I will."</p>

<p>"You?" said her father, in astonishment.</p>

<p>"Yes. I feel very bad about poor mamma, and I never
knew how much I loved her till now."</p>

<p>As she spoke she got out of the wagon.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?" asked Smithers.</p>

<p>"I'm going to ask that bold, bad man to let mamma go,
and if he won't, he'll have to keep me, too, for I won't
leave her."</p>

<p>"What madness is this?" cried her father.</p>

<p>"Oh, Alice was always a spoony, little fool," replied
Harold.</p>

<p>"I've been very wicked to mamma," said Alice, setting
her lips firmly together, "and I see it all now; but I
should not have been if you, papa, and Harold had not
told me not to mind her."</p>

<p>She began to walk back toward the canyon.</p>

<p>"Come back!" shouted Smithers. "I can't allow this,
Harold, go and stop her."</p>

<p>"Go and stop her yourself," answered Harold. "I
can't be bothered running after girls."</p>

<p>Mr. Smithers bit his lip till the blood came.</p>

<p>He had brought his son up to be undutiful and rebellious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
against his mother, and now he was reaping some
of the crop, the seed of which he had sown.</p>

<p>Now he realized the full force of the saying that "it is
sharper than a serpent's tooth to have a thankless child."</p>

<p>"Bring her back, I say," roared Smithers, who was
nearly beside himself with vexation.</p>

<p>Still Harold did not move.</p>

<p>He sat on the front seat of the wagon with provoking
coolness, and did not seem in the least alarmed at the display
of parental wrath with which he was favored.</p>

<p>The fact was he had never been brought up to respect
either father or mother, and he had arrived at an age
when it is rather late to begin to inculcate lessons of
filial obedience.</p>

<p>Hearing her father shout, Alice became alarmed lest
he would follow and bring her back.</p>

<p>In his angry state of mind, and in that wild and desolate
wilderness, he might even whip her.</p>

<p>So she commenced to run at the top of her speed, and
her form grew dim and more indistinct every minute, as
a slight haze was descending from the hills and enveloping
the valley in mist.</p>

<p>"Confound you!" said Smithers to Harold, "will you
do what I told you?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span></p>

<p>"What?" asked Harold, with the same provoking
calmness.</p>

<p>"Don't ask me questions, when you know very well
what I mean. Go after your sister."</p>

<p>"Oh, she's all right. The robbers won't hurt her, and
you know very well where she has gone."</p>

<p>Smithers was now in an ungovernable fury. His troubles
and trials of late had not served to improve what
was always a hasty temper, and to add to this he had given
way to habits of drinking since quitting New York.</p>

<p>Even that morning he had indulged in sundry drams,
which he had taken from a flask he carried in his pocket.</p>

<p>"If you don't do what I tell you, by thunder! I'll make
you!" he cried.</p>

<p>Invitingly near him, at the rear of the wagon, were his
pistols. He seized one and pointed it at Harold.</p>

<p>"Now, you young whelp!" he almost screamed, so beside
himself was he with excitement, "will you obey me?"</p>

<p>"I'm all hunk," replied Harold, thinking his father was
only trying to frighten him.</p>

<p>At that moment the pistol exploded. Whether Smithers
pulled the trigger intentionally or whether it went off
accidentally, we will charitably leave open to doubt. Certain
it is that Harold fell from the wagon to the ground,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
which instantly became deluged with his blood. He
groaned heavily, as if suffering acute agony. With a
cry of alarm, Smithers cast the pistol from him, as if it
had been a snake.</p>

<p>"Good Heaven! what have I done?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>Running to the side of Harold, he raised up his head.
The eyes were glazing fast, and he drew his breath with
the utmost difficulty.</p>

<p>"Oh, Harold, my boy!" cried the wretched father.
"Speak to me, speak!"</p>

<p>"Father, forgive," was all the boy could gasp.</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake! say you are not dying, Harold—my
own! Speak to me, Harold!" A faint smile curled
round the corners of his livid lips. There was a rattling
sound in the throat, and Harold had ceased to live.</p>

<p>"Oh, Heaven, be good to me. I have slain my son!"
exclaimed Smithers, throwing himself on the ground in
a paroxysm of grief.</p>

<p>He remained in a condition of stupor for more than an
hour, resembling a man who had been stunned by a heavy
blow.</p>

<p>At length he roused himself, and rising, looked around
with a shudder.</p>

<p>There lay the body of his son Harold, stiff and cold in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
the embrace of death. No blandishments, no caresses, no
power on earth could bring him back to life.</p>

<p>In the midst of that solitude an awful sense of loneliness
stole over the soul of the guilty man.</p>

<p>He was the murderer of his child. His wife was a
captive in the hands of a robber, and his daughter Alice
had gone to join in her captivity. All—all had left him.</p>

<p>He was alone in the world—he, who a few short hours
before had been blessed with the happy companionship
of wife and children. It was almost more than he could
bear.</p>

<p>Mechanically he sought in the wagon for a shovel,
and in a listless manner began to dig a grave.</p>

<p>The coyotes had smelt blood, and were barking at a
distance.</p>

<p>Overhead flew the lazy buzzards, for their instinct, too,
told them that death was near.</p>

<p>An hour's work made the grave deep enough for the
body, and reverentially he laid it in.</p>

<p>When he had filled it up with earth he sought for
stones and piled a rough cairn over all that remained of
the once haughty and spoiled child, Harold.</p>

<p>Dropping a tear over the grave, Smithers struck the
oxen with the whip, and the heavy wagon rolled sluggishly
on toward Silver City.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>Deep down in his breast Smithers carried his weight
of woe, and vainly tried to drown his load of grief and
care by repeated draughts of fiery spirits.</p>

<p>But the attempt was useless, for the fire in his heart
was raging fiercely.</p>

<p class="center">"WHO BREAKS, PAYS."</p>


<p>The doctor listened to the complaint made by the son
of the dead man, and assured him that he knew nothing
of the theft of the corpse, when suddenly a piercing shriek
was heard in the hallway.</p>

<p>"That is my housekeeper's voice," said the doctor.
"What has happened?" He rushed out of the room.
"Miss Minks," exclaimed the doctor, meeting her in the
passage, "why this excitement?"</p>

<p>"Doctor," she answered, "some one has had the audacity
to enter my sleeping apartment, and has actually
got into my bed. I have spoken to him in vain, and am
under the impression that he must be grossly intoxicated."</p>

<p>Garretson, suspecting the truth, snatched the lamp
from one hand, and entered the room. One glance at the
bed showed him that his suspicions were well founded.</p>

<p>When Miss Minks realized the fact that she had been
speaking to a corpse, she sank into a chair and fainted
away; but as nobody took the least notice of her she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
speedily came to, and contented herself with groaning
terribly.</p>

<p>It is probable that the mob would have done some serious
injury to the doctor, notwithstanding the presence
of the constable, had not Tommy come to the rescue.</p>

<p>"I must own up," he said to Bobsey.</p>

<p>"If you do, we shall be bounced," replied Bobsey; "and
then what will we do?"</p>

<p>"I can't help it," said Tommy, "a joke's a joke, but the
doctor mustn't suffer for our fun."</p>

<p>"You're a fool! Don't do it."</p>

<p>"I'll have to," replied Tommy.</p>

<p>Saying this he approached Mr. Garretson, and touched
him on the shoulder.</p>

<p>"If you please, sir!" he exclaimed, "I and another boy
did this. The doctor knew nothing about it."</p>

<p>Mr. Garretson regarded him angrily.</p>

<p>"Where is the other boy?" he said. "You must both
be punished for such an outrage on decency and propriety."</p>

<p>Bobsey, however, wasn't to be found.</p>

<p>The doctor was much relieved by Tommy's avowal,
and said:</p>

<p>"You see, sir, that what I told you was the simple
truth. These mischievous boys have made all the trouble."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>"Well," replied Garretson, "as the old story has it,
'who breaks, pays,' and he must suffer for it."</p>

<p>In his hand he carried a small cane, which he raised to
strike Tommy, but the latter did not at all relish the prospect
of a caning.</p>

<p>He ducked his head, and darting past the young man,
gained the head of the kitchen stairs, down which he ran,
emerging soon afterward in the street.</p>

<p>His quick eye soon detected Bobsey, who had climbed
to the top of a lamp-post to get a better view of what
was going on inside.</p>

<p>When he heard Tommy's voice calling him, he descended
from his elevated position and joined him.</p>

<p>"What shall we do now?" inquired Tommy.</p>

<p>"Don't you want to get 'ome again?" asked Bobsey.</p>

<p>"Nothing I should like so much, but where's the money
to come from?"</p>

<p>"Come on with me, right away, and we'll 'ave a good
try of it anyhow. I've got a few shillings to live on vile
we're looking for a ship, and I reckon ve'll be foolish to
hang about 'ere hany longer, as that cop hon the door-step
looks has hif he vas seeking for hus."</p>

<p>This advice was too good to be neglected, and Tommy
put himself by the side of Bobsey, who started off down
the street at a quick pace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>They walked to the east end of London, and passing
over Tower Hill, gained the extensive docks which line
that side of the river Thames.</p>

<p>Their long walk had made them tired, and they gladly
sat down on an old barrel, behind them being an extensive
range of warehouses, and in front, floating in the
basin, a number of ships, which were either taking in or
discharging cargo.</p>

<p>The ship nearest them was named the <i>Eliza Ann</i>, which
name they read on the stern, followed by the words New
York.</p>

<p>"That's our chance," exclaimed Tommy. "I'll bet she's
come over with grain or oil, and if there's any man
aboard of her who knows Jersey City, you can put up
your pile we're all hunk."</p>

<p>"Here's a chap coming down the side. Speak to him,"
replied Bobsey. "We want some place to sleep to-night,
and if we're going to strike a ship, it may as well be done
hat once."</p>

<p>The man approached the boys, and saved Bobsey the
trouble of speaking first by addressing them with the remark:</p>

<p>"What are you loafing about here for?"</p>

<p>"Looking for work, sir," replied Bobsey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span></p>

<p>"Who do you think is going to employ a cockney like
you?" answered the man. "Get out of here."</p>

<p>"Vell," said Bobsey, "you needn't be so huffish habout
it. Do you own that vessel?"</p>

<p>"None of your business; but, if you want to know, I'm
first officer."</p>

<p>"If you've hany hinterest in the domestic harrangements,"
said Bobsey, "you might hintroduce hus two has
cabin boys, you know."</p>

<p>The first officer of the <i>Eliza Jane</i> put his hands in his
pockets, and spit out a chew of tobacco.</p>

<p>"Do you know what cabin boys' pay is?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied Bobsey.</p>

<p>"It's more kicks than half pence, and if you like to
take that I'll ship you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," cried Tommy, eagerly. "I only want
to get to Jersey City."</p>

<p>"What!" cried the man, "are you a Yankee boy?"</p>

<p>"You can bet I am."</p>

<p>"Shake on that, sonny," cried the officer. "I'm glad
to meet a countryman, if he is young and out of luck."</p>

<p>"Do you come from Jersey City?" inquired Tommy.</p>

<p>"I do, and I fancy I've seen your face somewhere.
Didn't you travel with Charley Barker, the undertaker's
son?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Tommy, eying the officer delightedly.</p>

<p>"And your name is——"</p>

<p>"Tommy Smithers."</p>

<p>At this answer the officer's face became very grave.
He hesitated a moment.</p>

<p>"See here," he said. "They call me Boston Charley,
and those who know me will tell you that I'm no tale
carrier, but since I've happened to strike you in this odd
way I'll let you know what I heard. Your father had
to skip pretty lively from his home, and it is rumored
that he went West—some say to California, some to
Nevada."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"Well, if you must hear it, because he robbed his employers."</p>

<p>This announcement was a great shock to Tommy.</p>

<p>"Did mother go with him?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Boston Charley. "They went together
at a moment's notice."</p>

<p class="center">BOUND HOME.</p>


<p>"My friend and I have lost our situations through a
joke," he exclaimed, "and we want to leave this country.
Will you take us along with you?"</p>

<p>"Now you're talking, sonny," answered Boston Charley.
"This ship is going to San Francisco, and if you want
the straight tip, as these Londoners say, we don't have
any use for boys aboard."</p>

<p>Tommy's countenance fell at this declaration.</p>

<p>"Couldn't you make room for us, sir?" he asked.</p>

<p>"In consideration of your being a fellow citizen, I'll
chance it," answered the officer. "The cap and I are
pretty good friends, and I guess I can fix it for you to-morrow.
Meanwhile you can go aboard and bunk in the
fo'castle to-night."</p>

<p>Boston Charley nodded kindly to them, and walked
away, whistling a popular air.</p>

<p>"I say, boy," cried Tommy, "we're in luck."</p>

<p>"That's what I'm thinking," answered Bobsey; "and
I'll tell you where that cove's head was solid. He's going
to enjoy himself, and vy shouldn't ve do the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
thing? Let's go on a jolly good racket, our two selves,
and ven ve're on the briny ocean we shall have nothing
to reproach ourselves with."</p>

<p>"I don't care," replied Tommy.</p>

<p>They found out a coffee shop, where they enjoyed a
cheap supper, after which they went to the gallery of a
theater, at which a drama was played representing the
trials and temptations which beset Jack ashore.</p>

<p>Much delighted with their evening's entertainment, at
midnight they reached home—that is to say, the ship;
but the watch wouldn't admit them on board, and they
had to sleep on the ground among some merchandise.</p>

<p>It was late in the morning when Boston Charley made
his appearance. A few words informed him of the state
of the case, and he took the boys on board the ship,
where a few words spoken to the captain insured them a
passage to California.</p>

<p>The captain was a tall, swarthy Spaniard of the name
of Diaz, and Boston Charley gave the boys a little advice
respecting their behavior to him.</p>

<p>"Lads," he said, in an undertone, "our skipper's ugly
when he drinks. Don't you never sass him, because he'd
as lief take a knife to you as use his fist, and I don't suppose
you want to slip your cable just yet."</p>

<p>"Not much," answered Tommy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span></p>

<p>At two o'clock the tide swerved, and the ship started
on her voyage.</p>

<p>Capt. Diaz did not behave badly until the third week
of the voyage, when it was evident from his flushed countenance
that he had been indulging in intoxicating liquors.
He would walk sullenly up and down the deck, with a
rattan in his hand, giving orders one minute and contradicting
them the next.</p>

<p>Bobsey was one morning engaged in coiling a rope,
which he didn't do with the neatness and regularity
which he should have observed.</p>

<p>"Boy," said Capt. Diaz, "do that over again, or I'll lay
it over your back."</p>

<p>Bobsey looked up angrily at him.</p>

<p>"I'm doing it as well as I know how," he replied.</p>

<p>"Don't answer me!" shouted the captain, whose object
seemed to be to pick a quarrel with some one.</p>

<p>"If you don't want to be answered," said the boy, "what
did you speak to me for?"</p>

<p>"You confounded young whelp, I'll cut the heart out
of you!" said the captain, raising his rattan.</p>

<p>The next moment it descended sharply on the boy's
shoulders.</p>

<p>Bobsey was no coward, and big as the captain was, he
did not hesitate to tackle him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>Dropping on his knees, he seized his leg with his teeth
like a dog, and bit him severely on the calf.</p>

<p>The captain roared with pain.</p>

<p>Finding the boy did not let loose, he drew his knife,
as Boston Charley had said he would, and made a lunge
at Bobsey.</p>

<p>It took effect between the shoulders, causing him to relinquish
his hold and fall back on the deck bleeding profusely.</p>

<p>This scuffle had been watched by some of the sailors,
who cried "Shame!" but knowing the desperate character
of the captain, they did not dare to interfere on the
boy's behalf.</p>

<p>Boston Charley was below, as was Tommy, and the
first intimation they had of the captain's attack was given
them by a sailor who cried down the hatch:</p>

<p>"Hurry up! The skipper's stabbed a boy!"</p>

<p>"By thunder! it'll be bad for him if he has!" cried Boston
Charley.</p>

<p>He and Tommy hastened on deck, and were just in
time to see Capt. Diaz take up the form of Bobsey, hold
it a second in the air, and then cast it into the sea, as if it
had been a log of wood.</p>

<p>Tommy did not hesitate a moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>With the utmost bravery he precipitated himself into
the sea and struck out bravely to rescue his friend.</p>

<p>He could not tell whether he was seriously injured or
not.</p>

<p>He might be mortally wounded; and again he might
only be slightly hurt; at all events, he was determined
to do all in his power for him.</p>

<p>Boston Charley here took it upon himself to do the
best he could in the crisis for the safety of the boys, as
Capt. Diaz did not raise his voice in their behalf. In a
clear, ringing voice the first officer ordered the helm down
and the sails to be lowered, while he threw over the side
a couple of hencoops. In a short time the ship's course
was altered, and Tommy, who had caught hold of Bobsey's
right arm, was under the lee gangway.</p>

<p>"Lower a boat there," commanded the officer. "Lower
away lively, my lads."</p>

<p>"<i>Carambo!</i>" cried the captain, rousing himself at last,
"who is commander here?"</p>

<p>"When you so far forget yourself as you have done,"
replied Boston Charley, eying him sternly, "it becomes
the duty of every man in the ship to let you know that
they no longer regard you as their captain."</p>

<p>"You mutinous Yankee dog!" screamed the captain,
hoarse with passion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>"Capt. Diaz," answered the officer, "I want you to
know that an American is as good as a Spaniard, and
though you are part owner of this vessel, I don't give a
snap of the finger for you."</p>

<p>The captain brandished the knife threateningly.</p>

<p>"Put up that skewer," said the mate, contemptuously.
"I'm not a boy."</p>

<p>The only reply which Diaz made to this defiant and
somewhat irritating speech was to aim a blow at the
speaker.</p>

<p>But Boston Charley, with the rapidity of lightning,
drew a pistol from his pocket and sent a bullet through
the fleshy part of the captain's right arm.</p>

<p>The knife fell from his grasp, and the injured limb
hung uselessly by his side, while its owner reeled against
the mast.</p>

<p>"I'll have a terrible revenge for this!" hissed the captain
between his teeth.</p>

<p>Boston Charley paid no further attention to him.</p>

<p>The boat had been lowered, and while the altercation
was going on the sailors had picked up both Tommy and
the wounded boy.</p>

<p>They were just in time, for Tommy was nearly exhausted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span></p>

<p>When Bobsey was laid on the deck Tommy bent over
him, peering curiously into his face.</p>

<p>The mate took him by the arm and led him away, as
his experienced eye told him that the lad was dead.</p>

<p>"Oh! don't take me away!" cried Tommy. "He is the
only friend I've got."</p>

<p>The mate pointed with his finger to the sky.</p>

<p>"He has a Friend up aloft, sonny, and that's the only
one he will want now," he said.</p>

<p>Capt. Diaz had remained in a motionless condition for
more than five minutes, but his eyes watched the movements
of Boston Charley with the restlessness of a lynx.</p>

<p>All at once he stooped down and picked up the knife
which had dropped from his hand when the mate shot
him.</p>

<p>He held it in his left hand, and with a demoniac yell
he rushed upon Boston Charley.</p>

<p>"Look out!" cried Tommy, who, seeing that Charley
had his back turned to the enemy, feared he would be assassinated.</p>

<p>Turning sharply around, the mate did not hesitate a
moment in drawing out his pistol.</p>

<p>He had not a second to lose. In fact, so sudden was
the captain's attack upon him, that he had not time to
take aim, so he fired at random, and Capt. Diaz fell, mortally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
wounded, by the side of the boy whom, in a moment
of passion, he had so foully murdered a short time before.</p>

<p>The crew, who had watched this series of events in
surprise and horror, now ran aft.</p>

<p>"Boys," cried Boston Charley, "I call you all to witness
that I did this in self-defense."</p>

<p>The men showed the feeling they had in the matter by
seizing the body of the captain and casting it overboard
with as little concern as he had shown in disposing of the
boy Bobsey.</p>

<p>Boston Charley now took command of the ship, and
was obeyed by the men as if he was entitled to the position.</p>

<p>Tommy's life was now made much easier, for he only
had to wait on the new captain.</p>

<p>"A penny for your thoughts, my boy," exclaimed the
captain one day, as he noticed Tommy in a melancholy
mood.</p>

<p>"You shall have them for nothing, sir," replied Tommy.
"I was wondering how I could find out my folks."</p>

<p>"Tell you what, Tommy," said the captain, "when we
reach 'Frisco I'll take all the money that's coming to
me, and we'll start for Nevada together."</p>

<p>"You and I, sir?" asked Tommy, with great joy at the
prospect of having such a good traveling companion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span></p>

<p>"Yes; I guess there is more money in mining than seafaring,
and I'll try my luck."</p>

<p>Boston Charley did not waver in his resolution. When
the ship reached San Francisco, and the crew were paid
off by the owner, he, with Tommy, started at once for
Nevada.</p>

<p>He had taken quite a fancy to Tommy, and treated him
with as much care and attention as a father would bestow
on a son.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">TOMMY'S COURAGEOUS RESOLVE.</p>


<p>Leaving Tommy to pursue his journey, we must return
to Smithers, who, it will be remembered, wended his solitary
way toward Silver City, after the capture of his wife
by the robbers, the desertion of his daughter Alice, who
ran to her mother's assistance, and the shocking death of
Harold.</p>

<p>Trying to dismiss all the unpleasant recollections of
the day from his mind, Smithers drank more whisky, and
in time reached the city to which he had emigrated.</p>

<p>Entering the city through a spacious street which was
named Broadway, he then halted his wagon.</p>

<p>A man of tall stature and cadaverous cast of countenance,
who was lounging in front of a saloon, with his
hands in his pockets and a cigar in his mouth, approached
the wagon, eyed it critically, and then regarded Smithers
with an inquisitive air.</p>

<p>"Born East, I calculate, stranger?" he said.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Smithers.</p>

<p>"I'm glad to make your acquaintance. I'm Maj. Allston,
and well known in this town."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>The major might have added that he was too well
known to be trusted, for, though a smart, clever man, he
made a scanty and precarious living by his wits.</p>

<p>"See here, major," said Smithers, "I'm a stranger, and
not posted. You can call me Smithers. I've got a few
hundred dollars and the goods in the wagon. My intention
was to open a corner grocery to get a living."</p>

<p>"Won't do; there are too many of them. I'll tell you
what to do, and you can bet your life that I know this
community better than you," said the major.</p>

<p>"I guess you ought to."</p>

<p>"You take me into partnership, and we'll run a game.
The boys round here are all gamblers, and there are three
games in full blast every night, all making money—dead
piles of it—and no skin at that. Sail right in with me.
I know all the boys, and I can work the racket."</p>

<p>"But where's your share of the capital?"</p>

<p>Maj. Allston touched his forehead.</p>

<p>"Here," he said. "I've talent and experience. That's
worth all the money you can put into the concern. Is it
a go?"</p>

<p>Desperate and callous as he was, Smithers did not care
much what he did; he fancied that running a faro bank
was an easy business, and less tiresome than working
hard all day behind the counter of a store.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>"I'll do it," he replied, after a momentary pause for
consideration.</p>

<p>"Shake on that," cried the major, in a high state of
delight.</p>

<p>"Well, partner," exclaimed Smithers, "I'm in your
hands now. What shall we do first?"</p>

<p>"Leave it all to me. I'll sell the wagon, team and
stores to my friend who keeps that saloon behind me.
We'll engage his rooms over the store, and hire a nigger
to wait on the guests. I've got all the tools for the game,
and we'll open to-morrow night. I believe in doing things
quickly—that's me. Come and take a drink on me."</p>

<p>Smithers made no objection. Whichever way the current
of his fate ran, he was willing to go with it just then.</p>

<p>The major certainly showed himself a man of brains.
In a couple of hours he had sold the stores, wagon, and
team, engaged the rooms for the game, with the sleeping
apartments overhead, hired a negro, and begun business,
which proved very successful.</p>

<p>One afternoon, when the major and his partner were
in the gaming rooms discussing their future prospects,
there was a ring at the bell below.</p>

<p>The negro descended the stairs and saw a boy on the
sidewalk, who looked tired, worn and travel-stained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>"What do you want, sonny, hey?" asked the negro,
eying him suspiciously.</p>

<p>"If you please," replied the boy, "I want a job, and
they told me that perhaps the major, who keeps here,
would require an office lad."</p>

<p>"Go 'long; take yourself off right away," answered
Cæsar, "we've no use for boys here. If you're hungry
I'll gib you ten cents to buy some molasses and a bit of
bacon."</p>

<p>"It's work I want," rejoined the boy. "I have been
informed that I've a relative in this town, but I can't find
him. I and a friend came from San Francisco, but the
Indians attacked us, killed my friend, and robbed us of
all we had. Speak to your boss for me."</p>

<p>Hearing that there was some conversation going on
downstairs, Smithers exclaimed:</p>

<p>"What do you stand chinning there for?"</p>

<p>The boy started as he heard the voice.</p>

<p>"I must go upstairs!" he exclaimed. Rushing forward,
the boy upset the darky, and sprang up the stairs, at the
head of which Mr. Smithers was standing.</p>

<p>"Who are you, and what do you want here?" asked the
latter.</p>

<p>"Don't you know me?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I think I do. Is it—can it be——"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>Smithers hesitated.</p>

<p>"It is I—Tommy," replied our hero. "Oh! father, I
never felt so glad in my life as I do at striking you."</p>

<p>"How did you find me out?" asked Smithers, who did
not appear well pleased at the encounter.</p>

<p>"I heard you were here, and I started with a friend to
discover you. The redskins killed my friend, and I came
on alone."</p>

<p>The major had been listening to this conversation, and
he beckoned to the boy.</p>

<p>"Where's your mother?" he asked.</p>

<p>"She came with father," was the reply.</p>

<p>Smithers smothered an oath.</p>

<p>"Father," exclaimed Tommy, "I've gone through a
deal since I left Jersey City, and I've come here chiefly
to see mother! Where is she?"</p>

<p>"Dead!"</p>

<p>"And little Alice and Harold?"</p>

<p>"Dead also!"</p>

<p>The tears came into Tommy's eyes.</p>

<p>The major looked intently at Smithers.</p>

<p>"Say, pard," he exclaimed, "why didn't you tell me this
before? Did you see your family shot down?"</p>

<p>"No, but they were captured by Capt. Jordan."</p>

<p>"Didn't it ever occur to you that, if you'd been a man,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
you would have raised a hand for them? If you'd told
me, if you'd said a word to the boys we'd have made a
raid on the Snake Canyon, and Jordan wouldn't have
stopped any more travelers."</p>

<p>Tommy looked up with determination.</p>

<p>"If father hasn't courage enough to go after mamma,
I'll go by myself!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Bully for you, my boy," said the major.</p>

<p>"What's the use, she's dead and gone now; don't talk
like a fool, Tommy," remarked Smithers.</p>

<p>"The boy's no fool," answered the major. "I honor
him for his resolve, and I'll give him a pistol to fight
with."</p>

<p>He took one from his pocket, and presented it to
Tommy.</p>

<p>"That's to rescue your mother with," he continued.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," replied Tommy.</p>

<p>"If you're not back in three days I'll raise all Silver
City, and we'll root out this robber, if he hasn't skipped,
but I'll bet a five-dollar bill that you capture Capt.
Jordan."</p>

<p>Tommy bestowed a look of gratitude upon Maj. Allston,
and kept at a respectable distance from Smithers.</p>

<p>A man at this moment entered the apartment, and hearing
the remark, exclaimed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>"I'll see to that."</p>

<p>Maj. Allston turned round and looked curiously at the
stranger.</p>

<p>"You'll do what?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I'll raise you fifty dollars, and you daren't go me a
cent better."</p>

<p>"On what?"</p>

<p>"The bet you just made, to the effect that this boy
would capture me."</p>

<p>"You!" cried the major, in surprise. "I never saw
you before, and certainly did not speak of you."</p>

<p>"You are wrong in both cases," replied the stranger.</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>"We met three years ago in California, when I saved
you from being hanged for a horse thief."</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" cried the major. "Who are you?"</p>

<p>"Then I was Pedro Gormez, the bandit; now I am
Capt. Jordan, on the same graft."</p>

<p>"By thunder! cap, you're right!" said the major. "I
was doomed to swing, and if it hadn't been for you and
your brave boys I shouldn't be sitting in this chair now."</p>

<p>Capt. Jordan, the robber of the Dead Snake Canyon,
sat down.</p>

<p>"What brings you here, cap?" asked the major. "It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
isn't exactly safe for you to be in the city. If the boys
knew it——"</p>

<p>"That's what I came about, knowing I could count on
you, owing to that little service I did you down in California."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes."</p>

<p>"I keep myself posted, and I heard that the boys were
going to make a raid on the canyon."</p>

<p>"They did talk of it," replied the major.</p>

<p>"Well, I want you to stop that. I'm going to quit in a
day or two, and shall not give your people any more
trouble."</p>

<p>"I'll see to it," said the major.</p>

<p>Suddenly Smithers left the room, but quiet as had been
his movements, his absence was noticed by the bandit.</p>

<p>"Where has that cur gone?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"I'll be hanged if I know," replied the major.</p>

<p>"Gone to raise the town, I guess," said Capt. Jordan.
"Well, I won't give him the chance. My horse is outside,
and I'll skip."</p>

<p>"Good-day, cap. Come and see me again," said the
major.</p>

<p>Capt. Jordan moved toward the door.</p>

<p>Tommy placed himself before him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>"You don't go from here," he exclaimed, "before you
tell me about my mother."</p>

<p>"She is quite well, so is Alice. As for Harold, you
must ask the man you call your father about him, for his
hand is red with his boy's blood."</p>

<p>"Why don't you let mamma go away?" asked Tommy.</p>

<p>"Simply because she doesn't want to," was the reply.</p>

<p>Tommy smiled disdainfully, as if he did not believe
this.</p>

<p>"Come and see for yourself," exclaimed the robber. "I
will promise not to harm a hair of your head."</p>

<p>"That's a fair offer, and I accept it."</p>

<p>"You will come?"</p>

<p>"Expect me to-morrow."</p>

<p>The robber nodded his head approvingly, and quitted
the room.</p>

<p>Tommy sank into a chair and looked down, as if trying
to recollect something.</p>

<p>"What's troubling you?" asked the major.</p>

<p>"I've seen that man somewhere, and I can't recollect
where," he replied.</p>

<p>"Are you sure?"</p>

<p>"Quite. The face is as familiar to me as my own."</p>

<p>He tapped his forehead with his finger, but the recollection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
would not come to him, though he was positive
that he had seen Capt. Jordan somewhere or another.</p>

<p>His remarks about his mother he could not understand,
for it seemed incredible that she would choose to remain
a prisoner in the bandit's cave. All was a mystery to
him.</p>

<p>He was roused from his lethargy by the sound of
voices in the street.</p>

<p>A pistol shot was heard. This was followed by another
and another.</p>

<p>Rushing to the window, whither the major had preceded
him, he saw a man on horseback dashing wildly up
the street.</p>

<p>This was the robber captain.</p>

<p>Smithers had met the sheriff of Silver City, and given
the alarm, which caused a body of citizens to assemble.</p>

<p>The robber had barely time to mount his horse and ride
for dear life.</p>

<p>Fortunately for him, the shots which were fired did not
touch either him or his horse, and he made his escape.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">FINDING A FATHER.</p>


<p>Smithers returned to the room.</p>

<p>"I'll have to break with you," exclaimed the major,
"if you go on this way."</p>

<p>"What for?" asked Smithers.</p>

<p>"Didn't you hear that fellow say that he had saved my
life? See here," continued the major, "I want you to
understand that you can't play fast and loose with me.
Capt. Jordan will think I put up a job on him."</p>

<p>The major continued to grumble, but Smithers took no
notice either of him or Tommy.</p>

<p>In an hour's time it grew dark, and while the partners
were preparing for the business of the evening, Tommy
being very tired, stole off to a bed which had been prepared
for him in the house.</p>

<p>It was some time, however, before he could get to
sleep.</p>

<p>He was haunted by the face of Capt. Jordan, and in
vain tried to remember where he had seen it before.
That it was familiar to him he was certain.</p>

<p>"I know him, I know him," he muttered, "but to save<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
my life I can't place him. However, I'll go to the cavern
in the Snake Canyon to-morrow, and then——"</p>

<p>He broke off abruptly.</p>

<p>What would happen then, he could not tell, but he felt
assured that important events were about to take place,
which would influence his future career.</p>

<p>Early in the morning he descended from his bedroom.
No one was about. The major and Smithers had kept
the gaming room open till four o'clock, and then went
to bed.</p>

<p>Passing through the city he walked over the prairie
until he came within sight of the Dead Snake Canyon.</p>

<p>Scarcely had he entered the valley than he was surprised
to hear the voice of Capt. Jordan.</p>

<p>"Welcome, my lad," he cried. "Your mother is waiting
to see you. Follow me."</p>

<p>A winding path conducted them to the entrance to the
cavern in which the robber lived.</p>

<p>In a rude vault, illuminated by the rays of the sun,
Tommy saw Mrs. Smithers seated on a roughly made
chair, with Alice by her side.</p>

<p>She rose hastily, and embraced him with every demonstration
of fondness.</p>

<p>"My dear, dear child, I am so glad to see you once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
more," she cried. "How much you must have gone
through since we last met."</p>

<p>Tommy returned her caresses, and replied:</p>

<p>"I am happy now, mamma, because I have found you.
But why do you stay here?"</p>

<p>"I have my reasons," she replied.</p>

<p>"You would go if you could?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, my child. I am happy and contented. Soon we
shall leave here and——"</p>

<p>"We?" interrupted Tommy. "Do you include Capt.
Jordan?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"But he is a robber."</p>

<p>"He will give up this life, and we shall live happily.
It is not his fault, he has told me all. With me to guide
him he will reform."</p>

<p>"What is he to you, mother?" said Tommy, in perplexity.</p>

<p>Capt. Jordan was standing close by. Looking at him,
she exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Shall I tell him?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the laconic reply.</p>

<p>"He is my husband—the man I loved before I met
Smithers, whom I married, thinking my first love dead."</p>

<p>A new light now burst upon Tommy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span></p>

<p>"He your husband, mamma?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes, my dear, and your father," she said.</p>

<p>Now Tommy knew why the face had haunted him so.</p>

<p>Capt. Jordan was no other than the man Thompson,
who had taken him from Jersey City, and so nearly got
him into trouble in New York.</p>

<p>"Do you love him, mamma?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I do," she replied.</p>

<p>"Then I will give him my hand," said Tommy, "and
if you are not ashamed to be called his wife, I am proud
to be his son."</p>

<p>Capt. Jordan, or Thompson, took the boy's hand and
imprinted a kiss on his forehead.</p>

<p>"You shall never have cause to regret calling me
father," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>For the first time in many months Tommy felt a sense
of dreamy happiness stealing over him.</p>

<p>He had found his mother, and, what was more, he
had met his father under circumstances which induced
him to like him better than he had done at their first interview.</p>

<p>The result of Tommy's venturing into the cave was
certainly such as to surprise him greatly, for he was far
from thinking that Capt. Jordan, the famous freebooter,
was his father, and that his mother was living with him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
of her own choice instead of being confined as a prisoner,
which all supposed.</p>

<p>Thompson, or Jordan, was very anxious to quit the life
he was leading and had promised to do so shortly, at the
solicitations of his wife, and he wished to go further
west. Tommy's mother added her entreaties to those of
his father that he would accompany them, and having no
tie to bind him to Smithers, he consented.</p>

<p>Little Alice had quite lost all her haughtiness, and, removed
from the influence of Smithers, she found much
to love in the character of her mother, and though she
felt some repulsion toward Thompson, she grew to like
him a little in time.</p>

<p>Thompson was only waiting in the cave to make one
more venture before he left it forever.</p>

<p>He had received notice that a wagon containing bars
of silver would leave Silver City on a certain day, and he
intended to attack it as it passed through the canyon.</p>

<p>With this amount of valuable property he thought he
could do well as a farmer, and live a life of peace and contentment,
but he forgot that ill-gained wealth rarely if
ever does its possessor any good.</p>

<p>It was early one morning when a shot was heard in the
valley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span></p>

<p>Tommy sprang to his feet, he having been engaged in
conversation with his mother.</p>

<p>"What is that?" he cried.</p>

<p>"Oh," replied his mother, with a heavy sigh, "it's an
attack on some poor traveler. I wish all this work was
over."</p>

<p>"So do I," said Tommy. "Why do you stay here,
mother, when you could go away so easily?"</p>

<p>"I don't know what to do, my dear," replied she, in
her usual weak-minded and undecided way. "Thompson
is your father and legally my husband. I am afraid he
would kill me if I thwarted him. As for Smithers, I despise
him for his pride and his trickery. I wish I had
never married."</p>

<p>"Don't say that, mamma, for my sake," exclaimed
Tommy.</p>

<p>She pressed her lips to his face and kissed him tenderly.</p>

<p>"They call you the fool of the family," she replied.
"But to me you were always bright and amiable."</p>

<p>This conversation was interrupted by the entrance of
Thompson, who held some papers in his hand, which he
was examining with apparent interest. Suddenly he
uttered a loud cry of rage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span></p>

<p>"A thousand curses!" he exclaimed. "This is bad
luck!"</p>

<p>"What is?" inquired his wife.</p>

<p>"If we had only known who this fellow was he would
not have got off so easily."</p>

<p>"And who is he?"</p>

<p>"Who? The famous detective Berghausen, and here
in my hand is a warrant for the arrest of Smithers for
robbing his employers in New York."</p>

<p>Thompson bit his lips and frowned darkly, as if his
mind was ill at ease.</p>

<p>"I ought to kill Berghausen," he said, as if talking to
himself. "It is the only way to play a safe game, but
if I ride after him I may miss the silver, and not have a
chance of such a stake again."</p>

<p>Setting his broad-brimmed hat jauntily on one side of
his head, he quitted the cavern.</p>

<p>Tommy looked anxiously at his mother.</p>

<p>"It is my opinion," he exclaimed, "that you would be
better without either, of such men as Thompson or
Smithers."</p>

<p>"Remember, Tommy, that he is your father."</p>

<p>"I know it, and cannot help feeling sorry for it. He
is a bold, bad man, and although he says he will lead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
a good life in future, I am sure he'll never be anything
but a thief, and a low one at that."</p>

<p>The unhappy woman shook her head sadly.</p>

<p>"I fear," she said, "that there is no rest for me this
side of the grave. I must fulfill my destiny."</p>

<p>Covering her face with her hands she wept bitterly.</p>

<p>Tommy went outside and walked up and down in
deep thought, for he was in the midst of plenty now,
which seemed to make a man of him.</p>

<p>He felt restless and excited. Coming events cast their
shadows before, and he had that remarkable silent admonition
that something of great importance was about to
happen.</p>

<p>He was roused from his meditation by his mother's
voice.</p>

<p>"Tommy!" she cried.</p>

<p>"Well, mamma?" he replied.</p>

<p>"Have you seen Alice?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"She is not in the cave, and I notice that her hat and
little cloak are missing. Where can she have gone?"</p>

<p>Tommy reflected a moment.</p>

<p>"I think I know, mamma," he said.</p>

<p>"If you can guess, you are smarter than I am," she
replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>"I remarked," continued Tommy, "that she listened
with peculiar attention when she heard a man had gone
to Silver City to arrest Mr. Smithers. He is her father,
and she always had a great affection for him."</p>

<p>"I am aware of that."</p>

<p>"Then it is my opinion that she has gone to Silver City
in order to put Mr. Smithers on his guard, and enable
him to flee from the officers of justice."</p>

<p>"It is possible, but what danger may she not encounter
on the way! If she gets benighted the wolves will kill
her. Poor child, she is unarmed, and I should break my
heart if anything happened to her."</p>

<p>"Mother!" exclaimed Tommy, "I know what you
would say. You wish me to go and find Alice."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, if it is not asking too much."</p>

<p>"I will set off at once."</p>

<p class="center">THE FINAL TRAGEDY.</p>


<p>Seeing that his pistol was loaded, Tommy started at
once after Alice, who actually had started for the distant
city to warn Smithers of the danger in which he stood.</p>

<p>Skirting the huge masses of rock which lay about on
all sides of the valley, Tommy succeeded in quitting the
Dead Snake Canyon without attracting the notice of his
father. Once out on the undulating prairie, he slipped
out more boldly, and walked rapidly along the track
which served as a road. Some distance ahead of him he
fancied he saw a slender form which might be that of
Alice. He quickened his movements. In a short time
he was able to satisfy himself that it actually was the
little girl proceeding on her chivalrous journey without
exhibiting any apparent symptoms of fatigue.</p>

<p>All at once he beheld a tall form spring from the high
grass among which it had been concealed. The long
hair, ornamented with feathers, the red skin, and the
dirty blanket in which the form was wrapped, assured
him that the apparition was that of an Indian. Though
comparatively rare in that part of the country, bands occasionally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
crossed the prairie and did not hesitate to rob,
burn and murder where they had the opportunity. In
the hand of the Indian was an uplifted tomahawk. Horribly
afraid of some tragedy, Tommy increased his pace
to a run, hoping to come up in time to prevent the dastardly
redskin from doing any harm to the little girl.
But he was too late. The Indian uttered a terrible whoop
and, in pure wantonness, made a slashing blow at Alice.</p>

<p>The child, frightened at the war cry, turned, and beholding
the savage, sank upon her knees, holding up her
hands in supplication.</p>

<p>What she said Tommy could not hear, but even at the
distance he was from her he fancied he saw her lips move.
Possibly she begged for mercy, possibly she prayed for
help.</p>

<p>The cruel tomahawk, however, cut short her prayers,
or her supplications, and sank deep into her brain, causing
her to die without another word.</p>

<p>A fiendish laugh came from the Indian. His knife was
instantly in requisition, and with a dexterity born of
practice, he cut off her beautiful, flowing hair. He had
murdered the poor child for her scalp.</p>

<p>Burning with rage and indignation, Tommy bounded
over the ground, and when he got near enough he sank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
on one knee. Raising his pistol he fired. The Indian
was hit, but not mortally.</p>

<p>He uttered a howl like that of a wild beast, and looked
for his enemy, who was not so much hidden in the sage
bark and chaparral as to be invisible.</p>

<p>But before he could load his rifle another shot from
Tommy brought him to his knee, and a third rolled him
over like a bullock.</p>

<p>The Indian appeared to be dead, but to make sure that
the life had really left the wretch, Tommy struck him
again and again with his own tomahawk, which he picked
up from the ground, and hacked at him as he would have
cut a mad dog or a venomous reptile.</p>

<p>"Poor child," he said, as he stooped down and kissed
the blood-stained features of little Alice. "This is very
hard. I would have gladly laid down my life to save hers,
but it is one comfort that her young life is avenged on
the person of this bloodthirsty savage."</p>

<p>Alice was quite dead. Near the spot where she fell
was a cairn or heap of stones. Strangely enough it
chanced that this cairn was the one erected by Smithers
over the body of his son Harold, whom he had so cruelly
killed on this very spot.</p>

<p>Perhaps the very ground which was drinking up the
life blood of Alice had absorbed that of her brother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span></p>

<p>Not being able to carry the body to the city for interment,
and not liking to leave it to the mercy of the
wolves, Tommy tore down some of the stones. Reverently
lifting the body, he placed it in the center of the
heap, and covered it again with the biggest stones his
strength would permit him to lift.</p>

<p>Then the brother and sister were buried in one rude
grave.</p>

<p>"Poor Alice!" said Tommy. "God bless her!"</p>

<p>His first impulse was to return to the cave and carry
to his mother the melancholy news of Alice's death.</p>

<p>She had already been informed of the decease of Harold,
and had grieved much in consequence; but come to
think of it, he felt a conviction that she would like him,
if possible, to save Smithers from the impending arrest.</p>

<p>Following out this train of thought Tommy turned
round again and walked toward Silver City. It was
quite late in the day when he arrived there, but he soon
found Mr. Smithers, and told him all the sad news.</p>

<p>"But this is not all," said Tommy. "You are in danger
of——"</p>

<p>"Of what?"</p>

<p>"Arrest. The detective, Berghausen, is in this city
looking for you, and you may expect him here at any moment.
Your only safety is instant flight."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span></p>

<p>Smithers looked the picture of despair.</p>

<p>"I must fly," he exclaimed, after a pause. "Truly has
it been said that there is no rest for the wicked. But it
is hard to have no place to lay one's head, and to be a
wanderer on the face of the earth. Why was I not content
with little? All this comes of pride and living beyond
my income. Take warning by my fate, boy, and
whatever your circumstances in life may be, rest satisfied
with it. Pride must have a fall."</p>

<p>"Had you not better take what money you can, hire a
horse, and start, sir?" said Tommy.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes. It is very good of you to do all this for
me, Tommy. I had no right to expect it, for I always
treated you badly."</p>

<p>"Mother always taught me to forgive my enemies,"
answered Tommy; "and, of course, I could not expect
you to like me so well as Harold and Alice."</p>

<p>Going to the safe he took from it a large roll of bills.</p>

<p>There was a voice on the stairs.</p>

<p>"Ha!" he cried, "what is that?"</p>

<p>"For Heaven's sake!" exclaimed Tommy, "get away
somehow. It may be the detective. Can you not get out
at the roof?"</p>

<p>"I know not."</p>

<p>The noise increased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>The next moment the door was pushed open, and a
tall, thick-set man appeared on the threshold.</p>

<p>"You're my prisoner!" he shouted. "I know you from
a photograph. Up with your arms, or I'll give you some
lead."</p>

<p>Smithers failed to comply with his request, and hastily
drew a pistol, which he fired at the detective.</p>

<p>His hand trembled so that the bullet went wide of its
mark, and Berghausen, seeing that he meant fight, and
that his life was in danger if he did not adopt violent
means, returned the fire.</p>

<p>He was cool and collected, and did not miss his mark.
Smithers uttered a cry, and pressing his hand to his
heart, staggered against the wall, and fell on the carpet,
mortally wounded.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry," remarked Berghausen, coolly; "but I had
to do it."</p>

<p>Tommy had flown to Smithers' side.</p>

<p>"Are you much hurt?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Done for, my lad," exclaimed Smithers, speaking with
difficulty. "My race is run. It will soon be all over,
and I can't say I regret it."</p>

<p>"Shall I fetch a doctor?"</p>

<p>"No use. Pray God have mercy on my sinful soul!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>These were the last words he uttered, for though his
lips continued to move at intervals for some minutes, no
coherent sound came from them.</p>

<p>The sheriff, who was a man named Dunbarton, happened
to be passing at the time, and, hearing the shots,
thought it his business to enter the house. He saw the
blood-stained corpse of Smithers.</p>

<p>"What's this?" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I am a detective, with a warrant for this man's arrest
for robbing his employers in New York," replied Berghausen,
"and I killed him in self-defense."</p>

<p>"Well," said the sheriff, "if you'll take my advice,
you'll leave town and get back mighty quick."</p>

<p>"What for?"</p>

<p>"The boys liked Smithers, and knew his pard well;
they might take it into their heads to lay you out."</p>

<p>"That's so," answered the detective.</p>

<p>Accordingly he got out of the house, and made his way
out of the town, for he felt somewhat the hint given him
was equivalent to an order.</p>

<p>Tommy had not been noticed by anyone.</p>

<p>Seeing that he could be of no further use to the sheriff
or to Smithers, who was now beyond mortal aid, he too
left the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span></p>

<p>At the extremity of the town he overtook a wagon. It
was guarded by two men heavily armed, and he saw
Berghausen talking to them.</p>

<p>"You can go along with us," said one of the men, "if
you can fight, for we've got silver in the wagon, and are
told to look out for Capt. Jordan."</p>

<p>"Good enough," replied the detective.</p>

<p>"May I go with you also?" asked Tommy.</p>

<p>"No; we don't want any boys hanging onto us," was
the answer.</p>

<p>Tommy shrank behind at this ungracious reply, and
the wagon moved on.</p>

<p>Soon the shades of night began to fall, and, feeling
very tired, Tommy threw himself down on the sage brush,
and fell fast asleep. When he awoke the sun was riding
high in the heavens.</p>

<p>"I must hurry up," he remarked. "If the wagon traveled
all night, it has reached the canyon ere this, and
either Thompson has captured it, or Berghausen and the
others have overcome him."</p>

<p>He was naturally very anxious to know what had happened,
and walked at his quickest pace, his heart beating
wildly with anxiety.</p>

<p>It was midday when he reached the calm and pleasant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span>
valley, passing in through the high rocks on either side,
whose quaintly shaped forms seemed to resemble giant
sentinels.</p>

<p>Going direct to the cave, he found it empty. In vain
he called to his mother. There was no answer. Alarmed
and still more anxious than before, he proceeded to explore
the valley.</p>

<p>All at once he distinguished his mother's form seated
on a fragment of rock. At her feet was the body of a
man.</p>

<p>One glance enabled Tommy to comprehend what had
happened.</p>

<p>Approaching her, he took her hand, saying:</p>

<p>"Mother, it is all over now."</p>

<p>She raised her tear-stained face to his. Then she lowered
it once more, and cast her gaze sorrowfully upon
the corpse, which was that of the bandit, Thompson.</p>

<p>"We are alone in the world now," continued Tommy.
"Smithers is dead, shot by Berghausen; Alice was killed
by an Indian, but I will protect you."</p>

<p>"He attacked the wagon," explained she. "He was
killed at the first fire. His servant's body is down there"—pointing
with her finger—"with the body of one of the
travelers, who was killed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>

<p>"Come away, mother," said Tommy. "I'll return and
bury the bodies."</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>"What are we to do now?" demanded Tommy's
mother. "The future seems such a blank to me. Oh!
thank God that you are spared to me, Tommy."</p>

<p>"Mother," said Tommy, "while I was burying the
bodies, a man came along on horseback. He was looking
for me. His name is Maj. Allston. He was Mr. Smithers'
partner, and he gave me a roll of bills, which he said
was Smithers' share of the profits of the game they
played. It is over two thousand dollars. Let us go
back to New York. We will start in business, and we
shall not want."</p>

<p>Mrs. Smithers drew him to her bosom, and embraced
him tenderly.</p>

<p>"God bless you, Tommy. I will live for your sake, but
I had very dark thoughts in my mind just now—oh! so
bad and wicked; may I be forgiven for them."</p>

<p>The next day they went to the depot, and the swift
locomotive conveyed two travel-stained passengers back
to the East.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>They started in a little business, and Tommy, no longer
the fool of the family, showed such industry and smartness
that he prospered.</p>

<p>The mother and son were very happy together, and
soon the checkered and eventful past was forgotten.</p>

<b>Red-blooded Adventure Stories for Men</b>
</p>


<p>There is no more romantic character in American history than William
F. Cody, or, as he was internationally known, Buffalo Bill. He,
with Colonel Prentiss Ingraham, Wild Bill Hickock, General Custer,
and a few other adventurous spirits, laid the foundation of our great
West.</p>

<p>There is no more brilliant page in American history than the winning
of the West. Never did pioneers live more thrilling lives, so
rife with adventure and brave deeds, as the old scouts and plainsmen.
Foremost among these stands the imposing figure of Buffalo Bill.</p>

<p>All of the books in this list are intensely interesting. They were
written by the close friend and companion of Buffalo Bill—Colonel
Prentiss Ingraham. They depict actual adventures which this pair of
hard-hitting comrades experienced, while the story of these adventures
is interwoven with fiction; historically the books are correct.</p>

<h2>Alger Series</h2>

<p class="right">
<b>Clean Adventure Stories for Boys</b>
</p>

<p class="center medium">The Most Complete List Published</p>


<p>The following list does not contain all the books that Horatio Alger
wrote, but it contains most of them, and certainly the best.</p>

<p>Horatio Alger is to boys what Charles Dickens is to grown-ups. His
work is just as popular to-day as it was years ago. The books have
a quality, the value of which is beyond computation.</p>

<p>There are legions of boys of foreign parents who are being helped
along the road to true Americanism by reading these books which are
so peculiarly American in tone that the reader cannot fail to absorb
some of the spirit of fair play and clean living which is so characteristically
American.</p>

<p>In this list will be included certain books by Edward Stratemeyer,
Oliver Optic, and other authors who wrote the Alger type of stories,
which are equal in interest and wholesomeness with those written by
the famous author after which this great line of books for boys is
named.</p>

<p class="center medium">NICK CARTER STORIES</p>
</div>

<h2>New Magnet Library</h2>

<p class="right medium">
<i>Not a Dull Book in This List</i><br>
</p>


<p>Nick Carter stands for an interesting detective story. The fact
that the books in this line are so uniformly good is entirely due to
the work of a specialist. The man who wrote these stories produced
no other type of fiction. His mind was concentrated upon the creation
of new plots and situations in which his hero emerged triumphantly
from all sorts of troubles and landed the criminal just where
he should be—behind the bars.</p>

<p>The author of these stories knew more about writing detective stories
than any other single person.</p>

<p>Following is a list of the best Nick Carter stories. They have been
selected with extreme care, and we unhesitatingly recommend each of
them as being fully as interesting as any detective story between cloth
covers which sells at ten times the price.</p>

<p>If you do not know Nick Carter, buy a copy of any of the New
Magnet library books, and get acquainted. He will surprise and delight
you.</p>

<p>For the present the Adventure Library will be devoted to the publication
of stories by William Wallace Cook.</p>

<p>The fact that one man wrote all of these stories in no way detracts
from their interest, as they are all very different in plot and locality.</p>

<p>For example, the action in one story takes place in "The Land of
Little Rain;" another deals with adventure on the high seas; another
is a good railroad story; others are splendid Western stories; and
some are mystery stories. All of them, however, are stories of vigorous
adventure drawn true to life, which gives them the thrill that
all really good fiction should have.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="Not_How_Much">Not How Much<br>
<i>But</i><br>
HOW GOOD</h2>

</div>


<p>In the editorial preparation of the STREET
&amp; SMITH NOVEL the question of how much
in money we were going to get for each volume
never really occurred to us. We lost sight entirely
of the fact that these books sold at 15
cents the copy, and gave as much serious consideration
to the selection and preparation of
the stories as though they were going to sell for
ten times as much.</p>

<p>We think, after all, that this is the real test
of service. That we are performing a service
to millions of American readers, there can be
no doubt. Never before has such reading matter
been placed within the reach of the modest
purse. We have striven to keep our line clean
and feel confident that we have done so.</p>

<p>The very nature of the stories published in
the STREET &amp; SMITH NOVELS insures them
consideration from people who have no time nor
inclination to read the classics, and who probably
would not read anything else if they did
not have the STREET &amp; SMITH books.</p>

<p>Any decent literature that instills a desire on
the part of the general public to read is, in our
opinion, performing a real service.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="The_Dealer">The Dealer</h2>
</div>


<p>who handles the STREET &amp; SMITH NOVELS
is a man worth patronizing. The fact that he
does handle our books proves that he has considered
the merits of paper-covered lines, and
has decided that the STREET &amp; SMITH
NOVELS are superior to all others.</p>

<p>He has looked into the question of the morality
of the paper-covered book, for instance, and
feels that he is perfectly safe in handing one of
our novels to any one, because he has our assurance
that nothing except clean, wholesome
literature finds its way into our lines.</p>

<p>Therefore, the STREET &amp; SMITH NOVEL
dealer is a careful and wise tradesman, and it
is fair to assume selects the other articles he
has for sale with the same degree of intelligence
as he does his paper-covered books.</p>

<p>Deal with the STREET &amp; SMITH NOVEL
dealer.</p>
